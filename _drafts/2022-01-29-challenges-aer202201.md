I wanted to briefly discuss the challenges when conducting data provenance and reproducibility checks, at complex and highly interesting articles, with the example of four articles in the most recent (February 2022) American Economic Review issue.

<!-- more -->

The four articles are

- [Can You Move to Opportunity? Evidence from the Great Migration](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20200002) (Ellora Derenoncourt)

- [Imperfect Markets versus Imperfect Regulation in US Electricity Generation](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20172034) (Steve Cicala)

- [Political Turnover, Bureaucratic Turnover, and the Quality of Public Services](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20171867) (Mitra Akhtari, Diana Moreira and Laura Trucco)

- [A Satellite Account for Health in the United States](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20201480) (David M. Cutler, Kaushik Ghosh, Kassandra L. Messer, Trivellore Raghunathan, Allison B. Rosen and Susan T. Stewart)


Each of these articles posed a different challenge to my team. In all cases, they are highly complex analyses with large, sometimes very large, data sources.

Let's start with **Ellora Derenoncourt**'s *tour de force*  on the **Great Migration** (if you want the lowdown, see her [own summary](https://twitter.com/EDerenoncourt/status/1487094842350088192)).

The Readme notes that it takes "approximately 3 hours to run". That in no way accounts for the multitude of different data sources that Ellora compiled, and which any replicator needs to also re-acquire. 

All of those data sources are available to replicators "publicly", i.e., at no cost, albeit with various sign-ups (IPUMS) or possibly memberships (ICPSR) required. Many are available on authors' websites, and not in robust replication packages at data archives (like hers now is). It contains countless author-digitized analog sources, often from the 50s and 60s, for which the replication package is now a digital source for future researchers. A few data sources were obtained via private correspondence with other authors, and Ellora does not have permission to publish those files. The replication package contains 102 Stata do files, and a few R files.

Working mostly off of the Readme provided by Ellora, only connecting with her directly to obtain the files she received via private correspondence, my replicators successfully reproduced all of the figures and tables, and recreated (up to some bootstrapping/ lasso randomness) all of the analysis files. That did NOT take three hours. 

I encourage anybody to read the Readme, and to dig into the very transparent code and data structure. 

Let me turn to **Steve Cicala**'s impressive work on the **US electricity market**.

When we first received Steve's paper to check, we noted that many of the data sources that Steve had collected were otherwise quite difficult to access. At least one key data resource (from the @EIA) could not be made available to us, and will be difficult for others to obtain if they do not already have access to it. Other data are proprietary and require a subscription, which we do not have access to, to obtain gas prices, for instance. Whether extracts from such sources *should* be made available by the data providers is a question for another day. 

However, when faced with these challenges, we did not simply say "oh, we cannot reproduce everything, so we are going to do nothing." In fact, we worked with Steve to preserve those resources that he used that are *hard to obtain* but *public use*. Constructing them is in and of itself an arduous task. Preserving the result of that work would have been feasible as part of the replication package, but would have "hidden" these data. We thus worked with Steve to create three additional data archives:

- Cicala, Steve. “Hourly U.S. Electricity Generation.” American Economic Association, 2022. https://doi.org/10.3886/E146802V1. (30GB)
- Cicala, Steve. “Hourly U.S. Electricity Load.” American Economic Association, 2022. https://doi.org/10.3886/E146801V1. (14GB)
- Cicala, Steve. “Monthly U.S. Electricity Generation, Costs, and Capacities.” American Economic Association, 2022. https://doi.org/10.3886/E146782V1. (30GB)

So while the data are not included in the main replication package (in fact, the main replication package contains no data), the additional data are available to anybody, and can be easily found, for instance, when searching for "hourly electricity generation" on [Google Dataset Search](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/). 

Note that the replication package also takes into account that replicators may not have access to the proprietary data. Tables and figures can nevertheless be approximately reproduced, using fake data as a stand-in. Thus, we were able to verify that the code is functional. I also note that while the Data Editor team does not have access to the confidential EIA data, other researchers do, and can successfully challenge each other (see the 2021 [comment](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20200679) and [reply](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20201872) on Steve's [earlier 2015 work](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20131377), in which both teams of researchers - but not the Data Editor - had access to the EIA data).
