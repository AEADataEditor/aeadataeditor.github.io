Containers are "implementations of operating system-level virtualization," [^1], typically on Linux. The most common version is provided by [Docker](https://docker.com), but several other implementations exist. The use of containers as part of replication packages in economics is extremely low, and yet they have some advantages. This post will explore both pre-submission and post-publication uses of containers, as well as several shortcomings.

## What are containers

In a nutshell, 

> "A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another." [^2]

In particular, this means that all dependencies are handled, and there should be virtually no differences across time, users' operating system, and software implementation in reproducing the outcomes of software.

Containers

## Containers in computational social science 

For the (social science) research environment, this should, in principle, handle many of the common issues that workarounds and READMEs list. In this post, we will explore one such case, in which a computational issue was encountered, debugged leveraging both locally installed and cloud-based containers, and ultimately solved.

## Compiling Fortran code through a container

Compilers are the workhorses for high-performance computing, and many economists will program compute-intensive routines in Fortran, then compile and run such code. Both open-source [^osfortran] and commercial[^commfortran] are available. We describe two use cases for using Fortran in combination with Docker. In many cases, compilers require the presence of many separate libraries, and installation is traditionally complicated. 

The [CE-Fortran](https://www.ce-fortran.com/) project ("Computational Economics using Fortran", Hans Fehr and Fabian Kindermann) trains and guides economists using open source [GNU Fortran](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/). They have traditionally provided detailed installation instructions for all three operation systems, striving to make the development environment as comparable as possible across all three. More recently, the authors have started providing a Docker image to provide a consistent environment. 

Nevertheless, some of the issues cannot be fully handled in a Docker image. For instance, while the environment in the base Docker image can create images, it cannot be used to provide an IDE or for manipulating images interactively. For this purpose, the authors provide a second, much larger Docker image that includes a workaround (a VNC server). 

A second scenario is frequently encountered among the AEA's replication packages. Many authors, particularly in macroeconomics, use Intel Fortran compilers. While installation instructions have been streamlined, they remain onerous: the most recent Windows installation instructions rely on a two installers, and have a dependency on Microsoft Visual Studio - a separate installer - which in turn has multiple additional dependencies. Furthermore, authors rarely use Makefiles, a way to compile code and address dependencies commonly used in the open source community, and only sometimes use Windows-specific Visual Studio Project files. The typical instruction, repeated dozens of times, looks like this:

![Compiler instruction](/images/README_page07.png)

with subsequent instructions to manually run the compiled code. Such instructions are inefficient, and potentially error prone.

In reproducing a recent paper, we instead opted to streamline the process, making for a more efficient reproducibility check, and also -- if the authors were to adopt this process -- a more efficient development process.

1. Using scripting tools, we extracted all of the `ifort` commands from the PDF (34 lines)
2. We manually inserted the relevant directories, and added code to automatically run the compiled binary. 
3. The resulting script file (`run_all.sh`) looks like this (in `bash` notation - this could also be done as a Windows `bat` file):

```{bash}
# Code to run models 
# Author: Lars Vilhuber
# Based on instructions in the paper's replication package
# NOTE: this should really be a Makefile!
# Capture base folder

BASE=$(pwd)

# Compiler options

IFORTOPTS=" -qopenmp"

# Figure 1A

cd $BASE/rep_agent_models/tc_model_nongrace

time ifort $IFORTOPTS rep_tc_delta_array.f90 rouwenhorst.f90 \
  -o rep_tc_delta_array.exe && time ./rep_tc_delta_array.exe 

cd $BASE/rep_agent_models/tc_model_grace

time ifort $IFORTOPTS rep_tc_grace_delta_array.f90 rouwenhorst.f90 \
  -o rep_tc_grace_delta_array.exe && time ./rep_tc_grace_delta_array.exe 
```

4. We then downloaded the [Intel OneAPI-hpckit](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/oneapi-hpckit/tags?page=1&ordering=last_updated) (required 23GB of disk space, compared to the 24GB that the Windows install would have taken):
```
docker pull intel/oneapi-hpckit:2021.2-devel-ubuntu18.04
```
5. Ran master script through the docker image
```
cd PATH/model_codes
docker run --rm -it -w /code \
  -v $(pwd):/code intel/oneapi-hpckit:2021.2-devel-ubuntu18.04 \
  /code/run_all.sh > run_all.output.txt
```
This generated about 100 output files, without any further manual intervention. There is no separate installation process for the Intel compilers, a simple `docker pull` command allowed us to run all of the required files. 

When one of the compile steps required a larger memory size (25GB) than our workstation had available (23GB), we simply re-ran the following three steps on a general purpose server we had never before used for this purpose (but which already had Docker installed):

```{bash}
git pull (URL of the reproducibility repository)
cd PATH/model_codes
docker run --rm -it -w /code \
  -v $(pwd):/code intel/oneapi-hpckit:2021.2-devel-ubuntu18.04 \
  /code/run_all.sh > run_all.output.txt
```
(the `docker pull` command is automatically executed by the `docker run` command if the image is not locally available). 

## Running R, Julia, Python in Docker

For most statistical and other languages, in particular open-source languages, progress is continuous. In part what attracts researchers to these environments is the rich eco-system of add-on packages and libraries, most of which are available for free as well. However, combining versions of languages, packages, and dependencies to those packages can sometimes be a challenge. Various methods exist to "pin" packages used (see [renv](https://cran.r-project.org/package=renv), [checkpoint](https://cran.r-project.org/package=checkpoint) and others in R, "environments", [`pip freeze`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_freeze/) or [`conda env export`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#sharing-an-environment) in Python, `Manifest.toml` files and [package environments](https://julia.quantecon.org/more_julia/tools_editors.html#Package-Environments) in Julia). These rely, of course, not just on the ability to install the right packages, but also the right base software. In some cases, it can be challenging for users to install multiple base versions simultaneously on their computers - either because they work on multiple projects on their own at different times, or in collaborations with others. This is sometimes necessitated by changes that create breaks between versions (examples include changes in random number generators in Julia and certain breaks in R when version 4.0 was introduced). Programmatic solutions for this exist, of course, but add complexity to an often complex set of programs.

Thankfully, that same open-source community has also provided containers that lock in some of the base software versions, facilitating the simultaneous maintenance of multiple versions of the same software. We illustrate this with an example that we have used in some reproducibility cases with R. It addresses the particular use case of having multiple versions of R, but does not pin the particular package versions. See the tutorials for  [renv](https://cran.r-project.org/package=renv) and [checkpoint](https://cran.r-project.org/package=checkpoint) for even finer control.

To start, we identify from instructions provided by the author both the version of R and the required packages. From the required packages, we use a standard [setup program](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/docker-r-starter/blob/main/setup.R) and add those libraries to the list of dependencies.[^3] We then leverage the [R Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/u/rocker) maintained by the [Rocker group](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker), and build a custom R Docker image that should have all dependencies as articulated by the authors:

- `Dockerfile`:
```
FROM rocker/r-ver:4.0.1

COPY setup.R .
RUN Rscript setup.R
```

- Building the image:[^4]
```
TAG=v$(date +%F)
MYIMG=aer-9999-8888
MYHUBID=aeadataeditor
DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1 docker build . -t $MYIMG:$TAG
```

- Run the authors' code:
```
cd path/to/code
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd)/subdir:/code -w /code $MYHUBID/${MYIMG}:$TAG Rscript main.R
```

Note that for each project, we can specify a different R version, and we can even, for the same project, test the reproducibility with multiple R versions, by building multiple images. 

Furthermore, if we run into reproducibility discrepancies, we can share the resulting (public) Docker image and the very simple instructions with the authors. In doing so, we reproducibly share the failure to reproduce. We have done so, in fact, in several cases, though we will describe that particular type of interaction in the next section, in somewhat more challenging cases.
