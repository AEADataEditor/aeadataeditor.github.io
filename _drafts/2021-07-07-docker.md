Containers are "implementations of operating system-level virtualization," [^1], typically on Linux. The most common version is provided by [Docker](https://docker.com), but several other implementations exist. The use of containers as part of replication packages in economics is extremely low, and yet they have some advantages. This post will explore both pre-submission and post-publication uses of containers, as well as several shortcomings.

## What are containers

In a nutshell, 

> "A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another." [^2]

In particular, this means that all dependencies are handled, and there should be virtually no differences across time, users' operating system, and software implementation in reproducing the outcomes of software.

## Containers in computational social science 

For the (social science) research environment, this should, in principle, handle many of the common issues that workarounds and READMEs list. In this post, we will explore one such case, in which a computational issue was encountered, debugged leveraging both locally installed and cloud-based containers, and ultimately solved. 

- Run Intel Fortran through container
- Run Gurobi through container
- Run R or Stata through a container
- Issues with licenses
