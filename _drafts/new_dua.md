Question:

I am currently working on putting together a DUA to access data from a private company (e.g., think of something similar to using xxx's data but at a company with less of a track record of sharing data). I am reaching out because I have two questions about best practices for DUAs like this related to data replicability and general transparency. 

    Do you have any standard language you advise including in the DUA that would allow for a third-party replicator or a data editor to access the data just for replication? I found the AEA's resource on sharing restricted-access data and third-party replicators, if the DUA allows for this sharing. But I couldn't find any references for what to actually put in the DUA that might make this possible. 
    Do you have any other general advice about things to include in the DUA that increase research transparency? If you happened to have example DUAs that seem like good examples from a transparency standpoint, that would be very useful too.
    
    Answer:
    
    thanks for working on getting this incorporated into the DUA. I do not, unfortunately, have very good sample language - we haven't seen many DUAs that do it, but we are starting to see some of those. A couple of thoughts:

    most commercial/private entities do not know the role of journals and (data) editors, so I would focus on what such a (data) editor might do, rather than the name associated with that role.
    you might want to incorporate a permission to provide (access to) the data to  "a consultant, a programmer, or an auditor" for "the purpose of verifying correctness of the analysis through arms-length analysis". That would likely cover what we do as data editors, or what some other journals (extremely rare) do with reviewers. This is not so different than allowing for yet-to-be-named RAs to be added at a later stage, which you also want. The key characteristic is that the consultant, programmer, or auditor does not have any project role allowing them to independently publish data, or results from the data - that still needs to go through you (think of yourself as the DRB for the project)
    I don't have strong guidance on whether you want them to require sign-off (i.e., is the agreement for the "auditor" between you and the auditor, or between them and the auditor). We have seen both of those.
        I do note that there is a procedural difference between asking a data editor (me) for a generic DUA between you and them, or asking them to sign the same DUA that you have with the data provider. I can sign a default DUA (see https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/sharing-restricted-data) very quickly, but anything that deviates needs to go through my university's procurement office. The former is thus weakly preferred.
    Pushing the boundaries a bit, you might also incorporate some language about how long to keep the data extract (at the data provider, or within your own institutional backups) for a certain period of time. For instance, the extract might be rolled into the firm's backups, and kept there for x years, where preferably  x> 5 years.

I hope this helps somewhat!
