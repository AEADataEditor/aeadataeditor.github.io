# Preparing a reproducible project with WholeTale for submission to AEA


- create a tale on WholeTale (mark it as a private - that is the default); choose JupyterLab/Python
- create an empty project on openICPSR (create all the metadata, upload nothing)
- Upload stuff, into "workspace"
- Ensure it runs there.  Do a "Recorded run"
- Share it with me and Sofia Encarnacion.
- We can then verify reproducibility in a few minutes + runtime if necessary. Once confirmed, we will download the tale, and upload it to openICPSR.
- You then "submit to AEA", completing the process.
