# Template to be sent to a author for IPUMS-USA API trial

## Prepare email

> We are trialling a pilot process with IPUMS to create reproducible extract specifications from authors' IPUMS extracts. We would appreciate it if you could (a) give IPUMS permission to access your IPUMS extract space on our behalf (b) identify the specific extract (by number) in your IPUMS extract space that you used to create your CPS/IPUMS extract used in this article. Please communicate with us (dataeditor@aeapubs.org) directly, referencing your manuscript number. 


## Steps for journal

- [ ] Send email to author, or include in openICPSR comments
- [ ] With approval, forward to IPUMS+API folks
- [ ] Use as part of the replication verification process
- [ ] Request that authors include in their replication package.
