These  web pages provide unofficial and developing guidance on the implementation of the [American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/) (AEA)'s Data and Code Availability Policy. 

The AEA Data Editor defines and monitors the [AEA Journal](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/)'s approach to data and reproducibility. The [Data and Code Availability Policy](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code) outlines specifics for authors. [Data citations](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/sample-references) are an important component of the policy, as is [compliance with registration requirements](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/rct-registry). Most replication packages are deposited at the [AEA Data and Code Repository at ICPSR](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/search/aea/), but any deposit at a trusted repository is accepted. Following the structure of the **[template README](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/)** is strongly suggested, and will become a required element in May 2021.


The current Data Editor (2018-) is [Lars Vilhuber](https://lars.vilhuber.com) ([Cornell University](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/people/lars-vilhuber)). 


## Important information

The [AEA Data and Code Repository](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/search/aea/studies) can be found at [https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/search/aea/studies](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/search/aea/studies). [Detailed deposit guidance](aea-de-guidance/data-deposit-aea-guidance.html) is available. Data and code deposits by the AEA Data Editor can be [found here](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/search/aea/studies?start=0&ARCHIVE=aea&sort=score%20desc%2CDATEUPDATED%20desc&rows=25&q=vilhuber).
