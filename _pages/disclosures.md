We thank the [Cornell Economics Department](https://economics.cornell.edu/) and the [ILR School at Cornell](https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/) for providing us with computing resources at the [Cornell Center for Social Sciences](https://socialsciences.cornell.edu/) and the [Bioinformatics cluster](https://biohpc.cornell.edu/Default.aspx). We also benefited from a grant of [Azure Cloud Computing credits](https://datasciencecenter.cornell.edu/microsoft-azure-credit-awardees/), provided by Microsoft Corporation via [Cornell's Center for Data Science for Enterprise and Society](https://datasciencecenter.cornell.edu/). We also benefit from free evaluations of manuscripts on our behalf by [cascad](https://www.cascad.tech/). 

> We also regularly receive computational support from authors' home institutions. Consult our [latest report](/publications/) for the most recent acknowledgements.

We received a generous compute and storage quota from [Codeocean](https://codeocean.com/), a free license to use Stata 18 for one year in cloud applications from [Stata](https://stata.com/). We also benefit from Github's academic program for code and other materials hosted at <https://github.com/AEADataEditor/>.  None of the sponsors have had influence on any of the conclusions we draw. Many of these resources are also free to other academic researchers.
