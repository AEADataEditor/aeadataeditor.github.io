# Office of the Data Editor of the American Economic Association


These  web pages provide unofficial and developing guidance on the implementation of the American Economic Association (AEA)'s Data and Code Availability Policy. 

The AEA Data Editor defines and monitors the AEA's approach to data and reproducibility. The [2019 Data and Code Availability Policy](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code) (also [here](/DCAP/)), which was [announced on July 16, 2019](https://www.aeaweb.org/news/member-announcements-july-16-2019), outlines specifics for authors. [Data citations](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/sample-references) are an important component of the policy, as is [compliance with registration requirements](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/rct-registry).
