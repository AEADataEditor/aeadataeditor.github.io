Many more out there. The Census Bureau has procedures in place to review code (it's actually part of the release system). Yes, some parts of the code will need to be redacted, but you can get very functional code released.

Also, we require that an internal archive be created, and permission granted in the replication package so that others, with appropriate access, can access those files. See the first example for an excellent example of that.
