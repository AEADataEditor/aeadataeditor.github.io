title: Guidance on testing replicability of code

The code and data that have been archived should be reproducible and replicable. How do we test that?

## Generic guidance

Generic guidance is provided at the [Social Science Data Editors' Guidance](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/) website. 

## At the AEA

We use **[this template](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/REPLICATION.md)** to guide our replicators. 
    - [Example 1](sample-report.md)

We assess 
    - software availability
    - data availability
    - code availability and clarity
    - needed computational resources
    - time needed to acquire or use all of the above, and conduct the reproducibility check

## What if we don't have the resources

When some of the conditions are not met with our own resources, we may ask others to conduct a reproducibility exercise for us. 
    - Our [PROTOCOL](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-third-party) describes how we might request reports.
    - [Sample report 1](sample-report-3rd-1)
    - We may ask others to do so because
      - They are experts
      - They have access to the software
      - They have access to the data
      - They have access to computational resources needed
  - **No reproducibility check is discarded out of hand**
