title: "Updating Materials available on the AEA Data and Code Repository"
---

Once an article has been published in an [AEA journal](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/), the associated code and data deposit will also have been published in the [AEA Data and Code Repository](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/search/aea/studies). Both publications are considered permanent. 

For a variety of reasons, it may become necessary or desirable to update the code and data deposit associated with a published manuscript. Reasons may include

- the code or the data have been updated to more accurately reproduce the results in the manuscript
- the code or instructions have been updated to more easily reproduce the results in the manuscript
- data which previously could not be made available is now redistributable 

The full policy regarding such updates is available on the [main AEA website](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-revisions) ("[Policy on Revisions of Data and Code Deposits in the AEA Data and Code Repository](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-revisions)"). This document describes the steps authors would need to undertake to do such an update. 

## Initiate a new version

If the deposit was made after July 2019, at least one of the authors retains the ability to publish updates. If you do not have access to the deposit, contact your co-author, or the AEA Data Editor. 

1. Log on to the ICPSR system. You must use the same email address as originally used for the deposit. You should be able to see your deposits if you click on "Share Data".
2. Click on "Create new version". This will unlock the files, and allow you to delete or add files.

3. Make any changes as needed. To replace files, first delete the old file, then upload the new one. Keep changes to a minimum, but there is no need to retain old versions of individual files (see above - the earlier version retains all files, and remains available).
   - Note that the [AEA Policy on Revisions](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-revisions) requires that changes be kept to a minimum.
4. Update the README, or add a `CHANGES.txt`, as [per the policy]((https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-revisions)). Authors should list the files added, any changes made to the programs, and ideally the reason why. No more than a paragraph.
5. Once you updated all files (remember to update the README), choose "Submit to AEA" in "Change Status".
6. The AEA Data Editor will review that the criteria of the Revision Policy are satisfied, but conduct no other checks.
7. In most cases, the article will remain linked to the V1 deposit ("version of record"), but anybody navigating there will see a banner indicating that a more recent version exists (the V2 deposit).
