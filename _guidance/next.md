    excerpt: 'The AEA Data Editor team downloads materials from openICPSR, [conducts reproducibility checks](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Verification_guidance.html), and then writes a [report](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/REPLICATION.md). **This happens without interaction with the authors.** If changes need to be made, the report is communicated to the authors, who make changes and re-submit, the cycle repeating until the replication package is deemed acceptable.'

    excerpt: 'The acceptance report (possibly with some minor additional changes) is communicated to the editorial office and the Editor of the journal. This starts the copy-editing process, and at this time, the manuscript becomes "**forthcoming**." Small changes can still be incorporated at this stage. As soon as the replication package is completed, it is published. The manuscript is published once copy-edited and scheduled to an issue.'
