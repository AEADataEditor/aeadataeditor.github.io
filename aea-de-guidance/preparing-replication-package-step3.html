<h2 id="stata-packages">Stata packages</h2>

<p>Stata users frequently use user-written packages, which are made available to the Stata community via the <a href="https://www.stata-journal.com/">Stata Journal</a>, <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/s/boc/bocode.html">SSC</a>, or Github. They are typically installed using a small number of variants of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">net install</code> command (including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssc install</code>).</p>

<p>Replicators need to have the same versions of these packages installed. Stata does not (currently) provide a way to install older versions of packages, and a regular occurrence of reproducibility failure is due to changes in packages over time. We have some simple solutions to this problem.</p>

<p>First, use an environment to permanently install-project specific packages once and for all.</p>

<p><strong>Define the environment</strong> in your main file, after setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$rootdir</code>:</p>

<span class="k">sysdir</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>From this point on, all installed packages will be installed into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$rootdir/ado</code>, and Stata will look there first when loading packages.</p>

<p><strong>Install packages once</strong> if not present, but don’t reinstall if already present.</p>

<p><strong><em>Adding to replication package</em></strong></p>

<p>The following files should be included in your replication package:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>code/ado/<span class="k">*</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="r-packages">R packages</h2>

<p>For R packages, we suggest that users use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">renv</code>, and do not set a specific CRAN mirror. We refer users to the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html">renv documentation</a> for details, but in a nutshell, for an existing R project that is not using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">renv</code>, the following commands should be run in the R console:</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">install.packages</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"renv"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="c1"># only once</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">renv</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">init</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w">               </span><span class="c1"># only once per project</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">renv</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">snapshot</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w">           </span><span class="c1"># only once per project, after all packages are installed. You should choose to install all packages detected, then snapshotting.</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="n">renv</span><span class="o">::</span><span class="n">status</span><span class="p">()</span><span class="w">             </span><span class="c1"># to check status</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will create a file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">renv.lock</code> in the top-level directory of your project.</p>

<p><strong><em>Adding to replication package</em></strong></p>

<p>The following files should be included in your replication package:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.Rprofile
renv.lock
renv/activate.R
renv/settings.json
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Do not include the entire <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">renv</code> directory, in particular not the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">renv/library</code> subdirectory, as it is platform-specific (of no use to other platforms), and can be very large.</p>
