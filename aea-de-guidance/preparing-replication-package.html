<meta name="description" content="The steps in this document are being used in a pilot project.   This document describes how to prepare your code for verification, taking into account some of the most frequent issues that the Data Editor and his team have encountered in submitted replication packages.  Overview  We will describe a few checks and edits you should make to your code, in order to ensure maximum reproducibility. We then describe how to test for reproducibility before submitting to the Data Editor. All steps have been tested by undergraduate replicators, and should be easy to implement. Whether they take a lot of time depends on your specific code, but generally, these adjustments can be made by somebody with good knowledge of the code base very quickly.  Much more extensive guidance on the issues addressed here is available at https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/. We reference specific chapters there at each of the steps.    Checklist  Print off (as PDF or on paper) the following checklist, and tick off each item as you complete it. Provide the completed checklist as part of the replication package.     Main file: A single main file is provided that runs all code.   Path names: All paths in code use / (forward slashes) relative to a single top-level project directory ($rootdir, $basedir, etc.)   Dependencies: All packages/libraries/dependencies are installed via code once.            For Stata, these packages are installed into a subdirectory in the project ($rootdir/ado, $basedir/adofiles, etc.), and used by the code.       For R, renv is used (exceptions made for other package management systems if such a system is explained).       For Python, environments are used (native venv or conda), and the necessary top-level requirements specified (no OS-specific dependencies are included).           Displays: All figures and tables are written out to clearly identified external files, and the authors’ versions, as used in the manuscript, are provided.   Testing in containers: After all changes were made, the code was run using an appropriate authorized container, and the generated log files are provided.       Detailed instructions  Preliminary: Directory structure of a replication package  A generic replication package, housed at /my/computer/users/me/project, might have the following structure:  README.pdf data/    raw/       cps0001.dat    analysis/       combined_data.dta       combined_data.csv       combined_data_codebook.pdf code/   01_readcps.do   02_readfred.do   03_table1-5.do   04_figures1-4.do results/   table1.tex   table2.xlsx   ...   figure1.png   figure2.pdf   where     data/raw has the externally acquired raw data files (not modified by the authors)   data/analysis has the processed data files, generated by the code in this repository.   code has the code files.   results has all the results files.   For illustration purposes, we have used Stata .do files, and outputs in a variety of formats, but the same principles apply to other software, and to any output formats.     Note that we did not specify where the main.do file will be!   Step 1: Main file     You may or may not have a main file. The following should be adapted to your circumstances. You do not need to create a file that is called main.do if you already have one, but you may need to update your existing main file.      Reference: https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/02-hands_off_running.html   Creating a single main file is straightforward. However, you will want to make some minor edits depending on where, in the above template setup, the file is located:  Scenario A: main is in the code directory  The most frequent scenario we see (which we call Scenario A) amongst economists is that the main file is in the code directory:  README.pdf data/ ... code/   main.do   01_readcps.do   02_readfred.do ...   In this case, the following generic main file will work: 1  local scenario &quot;A&quot;          // Scenario A: main is in code directory local pwd : pwd                     // This always captures the current directory  if &quot;`scenario&#39;&quot; == &quot;A&quot; {             // If in Scenario A, we need to change directory first     cd .. } global rootdir : pwd                // Now capture the directory to use as rootdir display in red &quot;Rootdir has been set to: $rootdir&quot; cd &quot;`pwd&#39;&quot;                            // Return to where we were before and never again use cd  // Now run the rest of the code do &quot;$rootdir/code/01_readcps.do&quot; do &quot;$rootdir/code/02_readfred.do&quot; do &quot;$rootdir/code/03_table1-5.do&quot; do &quot;$rootdir/code/04_figures1-4.do&quot;   Scenario B: main is in the top-level directory  More common in other computational sciences, but also present amongst economists, is that the main file is in the top-level directory:  README.pdf main.do data/ ... code/   01_readcps.do   02_readfred.do ...   In this case, the following generic main file will work:  local scenario &quot;B&quot;          // Scenario B: main is in project top-level directory local pwd : pwd                     // This always captures the current directory  if &quot;`scenario&#39;&quot; == &quot;A&quot; {             // If in Scenario A, we need to change directory first     cd .. } global rootdir : pwd                // Now capture the directory to use as rootdir display in red &quot;Rootdir has been set to: $rootdir&quot; cd &quot;`pwd&#39;&quot;                            // Return to where we were before and never again use cd  // Now run the rest of the code do &quot;$rootdir/code/01_readcps.do&quot; do &quot;$rootdir/code/02_readfred.do&quot; do &quot;$rootdir/code/03_table1-5.do&quot; do &quot;$rootdir/code/04_figures1-4.do&quot;   Important     In neither scenario did we hard-code the path to our project directory /my/computer/users/me/project. This is not an omission, and it is important, because it allows the code to be run on any computer, without modification.   Step 2: Path names  Windows computers use \ (backslashes) in path names, while Mac and Linux computers use / (forward slashes).  Two facts:     Every statistical programming language can use generic path names using / (forward slashes). This ensures wide reproducibility.   The use of \ (backslashes) in path names breaks code on Mac and Linux computers.   About 40% of replication packages in economics appear to be submitted by researchers using computers running MacOS or Linux. With a bit of simplified math, if we believe that is representative of what future replicators will do, that means that 40% of users will not be able to run 60% of replication packages without some potentially widespread edits, because of those backslashes.  You should thus replace all path names in your code to use / (forward slashes), or appropriate functions. This is straightforward:  Stata  // Instead of use &quot;data\analysis\combined_data.dta&quot;, clear // Use use &quot;data/analysis/combined_data.dta&quot;, clear // or better use &quot;$rootdir/data/analysis/combined_data.dta&quot;, clear   R  # Instead of data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data\\analysis\\combined_data.csv&quot;) # Use data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/analysis/combined_data.csv&quot;) # or better data &lt;- read.csv(file.path(rootdir, &quot;data&quot;, &quot;analysis&quot;, &quot;combined_data.csv&quot;))   and similarly for other languages.  Implementing  In many cases, you can just globally replace all \ with / in your code files. Caution however is warranted if your code explicitly writes out $LaTeX$ code, which also (legitimately) uses \. In that case, you will need to be more careful.  Expert tip  If using a (Bash or Zsh) terminal, you likely have the sed command available. You can use it to replace all backslashes with forward slashes in all .do files in the code directory as follows:  sed -i &#39;s+\\+/+g&#39; code/*.do   Step 3: Dependencies  Stata packages  Stata users frequently use user-written packages, which are made available to the Stata community via the Stata Journal, SSC, or Github. They are typically installed using a small number of variants of the net install command (including ssc install).  Replicators need to have the same versions of these packages installed. Stata does not (currently) provide a way to install older versions of packages, and a regular occurrence of reproducibility failure is due to changes in packages over time. We have some simple solutions to this problem.  First, use an environment to permanently install-project specific packages once and for all.  Define the environment in your main file, after setting $rootdir:     Reference: https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/12-environments-in-stata.html and https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/template-config.do#L129   /* install any packages locally */ di &quot;=== Redirecting where Stata searches for ado files ===&quot; capture mkdir &quot;$rootdir/ado&quot; adopath - PERSONAL adopath - OLDPLACE adopath - SITE sysdir set PLUS     &quot;$rootdir/ado/plus&quot; sysdir set PERSONAL &quot;$rootdir/ado&quot;       // may be needed for some packages sysdir   From this point on, all installed packages will be installed into $rootdir/ado, and Stata will look there first when loading packages.  Install packages once if not present, but don’t reinstall if already present.     Reference: https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/template-config.do#L174   *** Add required packages from SSC to this list *** local ssc_packages &quot;&quot;     // Example:     // local ssc_packages &quot;estout boottest&quot;     //      display in red &quot;============ Installing packages/commands from SSC =============&quot;     display in red &quot;== Packages: `ssc_packages&#39;&quot;     if !missing(&quot;`ssc_packages&#39;&quot;) {         foreach pkg in `ssc_packages&#39; {             capture which `pkg&#39;             if _rc == 111 {                                 dis &quot;Installing `pkg&#39;&quot;                 ssc install `pkg&#39;             }             which `pkg&#39;         }     }   Some special cases (usually not necessary)  For some packages, the package name is not the same thing as the command name. Example: moremata. For these packages, the above code does not work. Use this code:2     Reference: https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/template-config.do#L187       // If you have packages that need to be unconditionally installed (the name of the package differs from the included commands), then list them here.     // examples are moremata, egennmore, blindschemes, etc. local ssc_unconditional &quot;&quot; /* add unconditionally installed packages */     display in red &quot;=============== Unconditionally installed packages from SSC ===============&quot;     display in red &quot;== Packages: `ssc_unconditional&#39;&quot;     if !missing(&quot;`ssc_unconditional&#39;&quot;) {         foreach pkg in `ssc_unconditional&#39; {             dis &quot;Installing `pkg&#39;&quot;             cap ssc install `pkg&#39;         }     }   Packages that are not on SSC may need to be net installed from other sources, including Github and personal websites. Again, this does not neatly work with a specific command check, and thus you may need to unconditionally install them. Use this code:      // If you have packages that need to be unconditionally installed from other sources (not SSC), then list them here.     // Example: grc1leg   net install grc1leg, from(&quot;http://www.stata.com/users/vwiggins/&quot;)     // Example when net install is not an option    cap mkdir &quot;$rootdir/ado/plus/e&quot;   cap copy http://www.sacarny.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ebayes.ado &quot;$rootdir/ado/plus/e/ebayes.ado&quot;   Adding to replication package  The following files should be included in your replication package:  code/ado/*   R packages  For R packages, we suggest that users use renv, and do not set a specific CRAN mirror. We refer users to the renv documentation for details, but in a nutshell, for an existing R project that is not using renv, the following commands should be run in the R console:  install.packages(&quot;renv&quot;)  # only once renv::init()               # only once per project renv::snapshot()           # only once per project, after all packages are installed. You should choose to install all packages detected, then snapshotting. renv::status()             # to check status   This will create a file renv.lock in the top-level directory of your project.  Adding to replication package  The following files should be included in your replication package:  .Rprofile renv.lock renv/activate.R renv/settings.json   Do not include the entire renv directory, in particular not the renv/library subdirectory, as it is platform-specific (of no use to other platforms), and can be very large.  Step 4: Displays  Displays (figures and tables) should be written out to external files, and the authors’ versions, as used in the manuscript, should be provided. In the prototypical replication package structure above, these files would be in the results directory.     Reference: https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/03-automatically_saving_figures.html and https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki/How-to-output-tables-and-figures   Figures     All figures can be written out to files. Journals like pdf and eps files, but png are convenient. You can output multiple formats.   Whenever you have displayed a figure, also exportit to a file. It’s a simple command.   Stata  // Example for PNG graph export &quot;$rootdir/results/figure1.png&quot;, replace width(1200) height(800)  // Example for PDF graph export &quot;$rootdir/results/figure1.pdf&quot;, replace   R  # Example for PNG if using standard R png(filename = file.path(rootdir, &quot;results&quot;, &quot;figure1.png&quot;), width = 1200, height = 800) plot(x, y)  # your plotting code here dev.off()  # Example if using ggplot2 ggsave(filename = file.path(rootdir, &quot;results&quot;, &quot;figure1.png&quot;), plot = myplot, width = 12, height = 8, units = &quot;in&quot;, dpi = 100)   More complex figures  For more complex figures, it may be easier to simply write out the data underlying the figure to an Excel sheet, and create the figure there. See https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki/How-to-output-tables-and-figures#arbitrary-data-to-excel  on how to write out the underlying data. You would then include the Excel file that maps the data into a figure with your replication package.  Tables  Tables may be more complex. Simple tables can be written out using various tools:  Stata  esttab or outreg2, also putexcel. For fancier stuff, treat tables as data, use regsave or export excel to manipulate.  R  xtable, stargazer, others.  More complex tables  For more complex tables, it may be easier to simply write out entire matrices, or individual numbers, to an Excel sheet, and compose the table there. See https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki/How-to-output-tables-and-figures#examples for an example, especially if you have already been compiling your tables in Excel. You would then include the Excel file that maps the data into your preferred table layout with your replication package.  Step 5: Testing in containers  After you have made all the above changes, you should test your code in an appropriate authorized container.     Reference: https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/80-docker.html   The following list of containers are authorized for testing, as they are reliably available, and achieve the desired transparency.     Install the software necessary for running containers.            For Windows, install Docker Desktop for Windows.       For Mac, install Docker Desktop for Mac or OrbStack.       For Linux, install Docker engine,  Podman, or use Apptainer. These can all also be installed on Windows under Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).           Use one of the following containers:            Stata containers for versions 19now back to 11, provided by the Social Science Data Editors at https://hub.docker.com/u/dataeditors, such as dataeditors/stata18_5-mp:2025-02-26.       R containers provided by the Rocker Project, such as rocker/r-ver:4.3.1 or rocker/tidyverse:4.3.1 (which includes the tidyverse packages).              When code has been adjusted as in Steps 1-4, no complex adjustment of containers is necessary.      Run the container, mounting your project directory into the container. For example, if your project is in /my/computer/users/me/project, you would use a command such as this (example for Stata):   Preliminaries  (may need some adjustment)  VERSION=18_5 TAG=2025-02-26 MYHUBID=dataeditors MYIMG=stata${VERSION} TYPE=mp STATALIC=/path/to/your/stata/stata.lic   Run the container  docker run -it --rm \   -v ${STATALIC}:/usr/local/stata/stata.lic \   -v $(pwd):/project \   -w /project \   $MYHUBID/${MYIMG}-${TYPE}:${TAG} -b main.do   if using a Scenario B setup. If using a Scenario A setup, use  docker run -it --rm \   -v ${STATALIC}:/usr/local/stata/stata.lic \   -v $(pwd):/project \   -w /project/code \   $MYHUBID/${MYIMG}-${TYPE}:${TAG} -b main.do   Success  If your code runs without error, and produces all expected output files, you are done! You can now submit your replication package to the Data Editor, along with the completed checklist from above, and the generated main.log as evidence.  If your code does run into problems, the generated main.log should have clues as to what went wrong. You should be able to fix these issues, and re-run the code in the container, until it runs without error.  Problems?  If you run into problems in Step 5, no worries, simply submit all the files as modified in Steps 1-4, along with the completed checklist, and we will handle the remaining issues.                See the LDI Replication Lab’s setup here. &#8617;                 A more customized setup might check for a package-specific file in the ado directory, such as the &lt;package&gt;.pkg, but this is more complex and may not always work. &#8617;">

Define the environment in your main file, after setting $rootdir:     Reference: https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/12-environments-in-stata.html and https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/template-config.do#L129   /* install any packages locally */ di &quot;=== Redirecting where Stata searches for ado files ===&quot; capture mkdir &quot;$rootdir/ado&quot; adopath - PERSONAL adopath - OLDPLACE adopath - SITE sysdir set PLUS     &quot;$rootdir/ado/plus&quot; sysdir set PERSONAL &quot;$rootdir/ado&quot;       // may be needed for some packages sysdir   From this point on, all installed packages will be installed into $rootdir/ado, and Stata will look there first when loading packages.  Install packages once if not present, but don’t reinstall if already present.     Reference: https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/template-config.do#L174   *** Add required packages from SSC to this list *** local ssc_packages &quot;&quot;     // Example:     // local ssc_packages &quot;estout boottest&quot;     //      display in red &quot;============ Installing packages/commands from SSC =============&quot;     display in red &quot;== Packages: `ssc_packages&#39;&quot;     if !missing(&quot;`ssc_packages&#39;&quot;) {         foreach pkg in `ssc_packages&#39; {             capture which `pkg&#39;             if _rc == 111 {                                 dis &quot;Installing `pkg&#39;&quot;                 ssc install `pkg&#39;             }             which `pkg&#39;         }     }   Some special cases (usually not necessary)  For some packages, the package name is not the same thing as the command name. Example: moremata. For these packages, the above code does not work. Use this code:2     Reference: https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/template-config.do#L187       // If you have packages that need to be unconditionally installed (the name of the package differs from the included commands), then list them here.     // examples are moremata, egennmore, blindschemes, etc. local ssc_unconditional &quot;&quot; /* add unconditionally installed packages */     display in red &quot;=============== Unconditionally installed packages from SSC ===============&quot;     display in red &quot;== Packages: `ssc_unconditional&#39;&quot;     if !missing(&quot;`ssc_unconditional&#39;&quot;) {         foreach pkg in `ssc_unconditional&#39; {             dis &quot;Installing `pkg&#39;&quot;             cap ssc install `pkg&#39;         }     }   Packages that are not on SSC may need to be net installed from other sources, including Github and personal websites. Again, this does not neatly work with a specific command check, and thus you may need to unconditionally install them. Use this code:      // If you have packages that need to be unconditionally installed from other sources (not SSC), then list them here.     // Example: grc1leg   net install grc1leg, from(&quot;http://www.stata.com/users/vwiggins/&quot;)     // Example when net install is not an option    cap mkdir &quot;$rootdir/ado/plus/e&quot;   cap copy http://www.sacarny.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ebayes.ado &quot;$rootdir/ado/plus/e/ebayes.ado&quot;   Adding to replication package  The following files should be included in your replication package:  code/ado/*   R packages  For R packages, we suggest that users use renv, and do not set a specific CRAN mirror. We refer users to the renv documentation for details, but in a nutshell, for an existing R project that is not using renv, the following commands should be run in the R console:  install.packages(&quot;renv&quot;)  # only once renv::init()               # only once per project renv::snapshot()           # only once per project, after all packages are installed. You should choose to install all packages detected, then snapshotting. renv::status()             # to check status   This will create a file renv.lock in the top-level directory of your project.  Adding to replication package  The following files should be included in your replication package:  .Rprofile renv.lock renv/activate.R renv/settings.json   Do not include the entire renv directory, in particular not the renv/library subdirectory, as it is platform-specific (of no use to other platforms), and can be very large.  Step 4: Displays  Displays (figures and tables) should be written out to external files, and the authors’ versions, as used in the manuscript, should be provided. In the prototypical replication package structure above, these files would be in the results directory.     Reference: https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/03-automatically_saving_figures.html and https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki/How-to-output-tables-and-figures   Figures     All figures can be written out to files. Journals like pdf and eps files, but png are convenient. You can output multiple formats.   Whenever you have displayed a figure, also exportit to a file. It’s a simple command.   Stata  // Example for PNG graph export &quot;$rootdir/results/figure1.png&quot;, replace width(1200) height(800)  // Example for PDF graph export &quot;$rootdir/results/figure1.pdf&quot;, replace   R  # Example for PNG if using standard R png(filename = file.path(rootdir, &quot;results&quot;, &quot;figure1.png&quot;), width = 1200, height = 800) plot(x, y)  # your plotting code here dev.off()  # Example if using ggplot2 ggsave(filename = file.path(rootdir, &quot;results&quot;, &quot;figure1.png&quot;), plot = myplot, width = 12, height = 8, units = &quot;in&quot;, dpi = 100)   More complex figures  For more complex figures, it may be easier to simply write out the data underlying the figure to an Excel sheet, and create the figure there. See https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki/How-to-output-tables-and-figures#arbitrary-data-to-excel  on how to write out the underlying data. You would then include the Excel file that maps the data into a figure with your replication package.  Tables  Tables may be more complex. Simple tables can be written out using various tools:  Stata  esttab or outreg2, also putexcel. For fancier stuff, treat tables as data, use regsave or export excel to manipulate.  R  xtable, stargazer, others.  More complex tables  For more complex tables, it may be easier to simply write out entire matrices, or individual numbers, to an Excel sheet, and compose the table there. See https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki/How-to-output-tables-and-figures#examples for an example, especially if you have already been compiling your tables in Excel. You would then include the Excel file that maps the data into your preferred table layout with your replication package.  Step 5: Testing in containers  After you have made all the above changes, you should test your code in an appropriate authorized container.     Reference: https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/80-docker.html   The following list of containers are authorized for testing, as they are reliably available, and achieve the desired transparency.     Install the software necessary for running containers.            For Windows, install Docker Desktop for Windows.       For Mac, install Docker Desktop for Mac or OrbStack.       For Linux, install Docker engine,  Podman, or use Apptainer. These can all also be installed on Windows under Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).           Use one of the following containers:            Stata containers for versions 19now back to 11, provided by the Social Science Data Editors at https://hub.docker.com/u/dataeditors, such as dataeditors/stata18_5-mp:2025-02-26.       R containers provided by the Rocker Project, such as rocker/r-ver:4.3.1 or rocker/tidyverse:4.3.1 (which includes the tidyverse packages).              When code has been adjusted as in Steps 1-4, no complex adjustment of containers is necessary.      Run the container, mounting your project directory into the container. For example, if your project is in /my/computer/users/me/project, you would use a command such as this (example for Stata):   Preliminaries  (may need some adjustment)  VERSION=18_5 TAG=2025-02-26 MYHUBID=dataeditors MYIMG=stata${VERSION} TYPE=mp STATALIC=/path/to/your/stata/stata.lic   Run the container  docker run -it --rm \   -v ${STATALIC}:/usr/local/stata/stata.lic \   -v $(pwd):/project \   -w /project \   $MYHUBID/${MYIMG}-${TYPE}:${TAG} -b main.do   if using a Scenario B setup. If using a Scenario A setup, use  docker run -it --rm \   -v ${STATALIC}:/usr/local/stata/stata.lic \   -v $(pwd):/project \   -w /project/code \   $MYHUBID/${MYIMG}-${TYPE}:${TAG} -b main.do   Success  If your code runs without error, and produces all expected output files, you are done! You can now submit your replication package to the Data Editor, along with the completed checklist from above, and the generated main.log as evidence.  If your code does run into problems, the generated main.log should have clues as to what went wrong. You should be able to fix these issues, and re-run the code in the container, until it runs without error.  Problems?  If you run into problems in Step 5, no worries, simply submit all the files as modified in Steps 1-4, along with the completed checklist, and we will handle the remaining issues.                See the LDI Replication Lab’s setup here. &#8617;                 A more customized setup might check for a package-specific file in the ado directory, such as the &lt;package&gt;.pkg, but this is more complex and may not always work. &#8617;">

    <meta itemprop="headline" content="Preparing your code for computational verification">
    <meta itemprop="description" content="  The steps in this document are being used in a pilot project.This document describes how to prepare your code for verification, taking into account some of the most frequent issues that the Data Editor and his team have encountered in submitted replication packages.OverviewWe will describe a few checks and edits you should make to your code, in order to ensure maximum reproducibility. We then describe how to test for reproducibility before submitting to the Data Editor. All steps have been tested by undergraduate replicators, and should be easy to implement. Whether they take a lot of time depends on your specific code, but generally, these adjustments can be made by somebody with good knowledge of the code base very quickly.Much more extensive guidance on the issues addressed here is available at https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/. We reference specific chapters there at each of the steps.ChecklistPrint off (as PDF or on paper) the following checklist, and tick off each item as you complete it. Provide the completed checklist as part of the replication package.  Main file: A single main file is provided that runs all code.  Path names: All paths in code use / (forward slashes) relative to a single top-level project directory ($rootdir, $basedir, etc.)  Dependencies: All packages/libraries/dependencies are installed via code once.          For Stata, these packages are installed into a subdirectory in the project ($rootdir/ado, $basedir/adofiles, etc.), and used by the code.      For R, renv is used (exceptions made for other package management systems if such a system is explained).      For Python, environments are used (native venv or conda), and the necessary top-level requirements specified (no OS-specific dependencies are included).        Displays: All figures and tables are written out to clearly identified external files, and the authors’ versions, as used in the manuscript, are provided.  Testing in containers: After all changes were made, the code was run using an appropriate authorized container, and the generated log files are provided.Detailed instructionsPreliminary: Directory structure of a replication packageA generic replication package, housed at /my/computer/users/me/project, might have the following structure:README.pdfdata/   raw/      cps0001.dat   analysis/      combined_data.dta      combined_data.csv      combined_data_codebook.pdfcode/  01_readcps.do  02_readfred.do  03_table1-5.do  04_figures1-4.doresults/  table1.tex  table2.xlsx  ...  figure1.png  figure2.pdfwhere  data/raw has the externally acquired raw data files (not modified by the authors)  data/analysis has the processed data files, generated by the code in this repository.  code has the code files.  results has all the results files.For illustration purposes, we have used Stata .do files, and outputs in a variety of formats, but the same principles apply to other software, and to any output formats.  Note that we did not specify where the main.do file will be!Step 1: Main file  You may or may not have a main file. The following should be adapted to your circumstances. You do not need to create a file that is called main.do if you already have one, but you may need to update your existing main file.  Reference: https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/02-hands_off_running.htmlCreating a single main file is straightforward. However, you will want to make some minor edits depending on where, in the above template setup, the file is located:Scenario A: main is in the code directoryThe most frequent scenario we see (which we call Scenario A) amongst economists is that the main file is in the code directory:README.pdfdata/...code/  main.do  01_readcps.do  02_readfred.do...In this case, the following generic main file will work: 1local scenario &quot;A&quot;          // Scenario A: main is in code directorylocal pwd : pwd                     // This always captures the current directoryif &quot;`scenario&#39;&quot; == &quot;A&quot; {             // If in Scenario A, we need to change directory first    cd ..}global rootdir : pwd                // Now capture the directory to use as rootdirdisplay in red &quot;Rootdir has been set to: $rootdir&quot;cd &quot;`pwd&#39;&quot;                            // Return to where we were before and never again use cd// Now run the rest of the codedo &quot;$rootdir/code/01_readcps.do&quot;do &quot;$rootdir/code/02_readfred.do&quot;do &quot;$rootdir/code/03_table1-5.do&quot;do &quot;$rootdir/code/04_figures1-4.do&quot;Scenario B: main is in the top-level directoryMore common in other computational sciences, but also present amongst economists, is that the main file is in the top-level directory:README.pdfmain.dodata/...code/  01_readcps.do  02_readfred.do...In this case, the following generic main file will work:local scenario &quot;B&quot;          // Scenario B: main is in project top-level directorylocal pwd : pwd                     // This always captures the current directoryif &quot;`scenario&#39;&quot; == &quot;A&quot; {             // If in Scenario A, we need to change directory first    cd ..}global rootdir : pwd                // Now capture the directory to use as rootdirdisplay in red &quot;Rootdir has been set to: $rootdir&quot;cd &quot;`pwd&#39;&quot;                            // Return to where we were before and never again use cd// Now run the rest of the codedo &quot;$rootdir/code/01_readcps.do&quot;do &quot;$rootdir/code/02_readfred.do&quot;do &quot;$rootdir/code/03_table1-5.do&quot;do &quot;$rootdir/code/04_figures1-4.do&quot;Important  In neither scenario did we hard-code the path to our project directory /my/computer/users/me/project. This is not an omission, and it is important, because it allows the code to be run on any computer, without modification.Step 2: Path namesWindows computers use \ (backslashes) in path names, while Mac and Linux computers use / (forward slashes).Two facts:  Every statistical programming language can use generic path names using / (forward slashes). This ensures wide reproducibility.  The use of \ (backslashes) in path names breaks code on Mac and Linux computers.About 40% of replication packages in economics appear to be submitted by researchers using computers running MacOS or Linux. With a bit of simplified math, if we believe that is representative of what future replicators will do, that means that 40% of users will not be able to run 60% of replication packages without some potentially widespread edits, because of those backslashes.You should thus replace all path names in your code to use / (forward slashes), or appropriate functions. This is straightforward:Stata// Instead ofuse &quot;data\analysis\combined_data.dta&quot;, clear// Useuse &quot;data/analysis/combined_data.dta&quot;, clear// or betteruse &quot;$rootdir/data/analysis/combined_data.dta&quot;, clearR# Instead ofdata &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data\\analysis\\combined_data.csv&quot;)# Usedata &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/analysis/combined_data.csv&quot;)# or betterdata &lt;- read.csv(file.path(rootdir, &quot;data&quot;, &quot;analysis&quot;, &quot;combined_data.csv&quot;))and similarly for other languages.ImplementingIn many cases, you can just globally replace all \ with / in your code files. Caution however is warranted if your code explicitly writes out $LaTeX$ code, which also (legitimately) uses \. In that case, you will need to be more careful.Expert tipIf using a (Bash or Zsh) terminal, you likely have the sed command available. You can use it to replace all backslashes with forward slashes in all .do files in the code directory as follows:sed -i &#39;s+\\+/+g&#39; code/*.doStep 3: DependenciesStata packagesStata users frequently use user-written packages, which are made available to the Stata community via the Stata Journal, SSC, or Github. They are typically installed using a small number of variants of the net install command (including ssc install).Replicators need to have the same versions of these packages installed. Stata does not (currently) provide a way to install older versions of packages, and a regular occurrence of reproducibility failure is due to changes in packages over time. We have some simple solutions to this problem.First, use an environment to permanently install-project specific packages once and for all.Define the environment in your main file, after setting $rootdir:  Reference: https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/12-environments-in-stata.html and https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/template-config.do#L129/* install any packages locally */di &quot;=== Redirecting where Stata searches for ado files ===&quot;capture mkdir &quot;$rootdir/ado&quot;adopath - PERSONALadopath - OLDPLACEadopath - SITEsysdir set PLUS     &quot;$rootdir/ado/plus&quot;sysdir set PERSONAL &quot;$rootdir/ado&quot;       // may be needed for some packagessysdirFrom this point on, all installed packages will be installed into $rootdir/ado, and Stata will look there first when loading packages.Install packages once if not present, but don’t reinstall if already present.  Reference: https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/template-config.do#L174*** Add required packages from SSC to this list ***local ssc_packages &quot;&quot;    // Example:    // local ssc_packages &quot;estout boottest&quot;    //     display in red &quot;============ Installing packages/commands from SSC =============&quot;    display in red &quot;== Packages: `ssc_packages&#39;&quot;    if !missing(&quot;`ssc_packages&#39;&quot;) {        foreach pkg in `ssc_packages&#39; {            capture which `pkg&#39;            if _rc == 111 {                                dis &quot;Installing `pkg&#39;&quot;                ssc install `pkg&#39;            }            which `pkg&#39;        }    }Some special cases (usually not necessary)For some packages, the package name is not the same thing as the command name. Example: moremata. For these packages, the above code does not work. Use this code:2  Reference: https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/template-config.do#L187    // If you have packages that need to be unconditionally installed (the name of the package differs from the included commands), then list them here.    // examples are moremata, egennmore, blindschemes, etc.local ssc_unconditional &quot;&quot;/* add unconditionally installed packages */    display in red &quot;=============== Unconditionally installed packages from SSC ===============&quot;    display in red &quot;== Packages: `ssc_unconditional&#39;&quot;    if !missing(&quot;`ssc_unconditional&#39;&quot;) {        foreach pkg in `ssc_unconditional&#39; {            dis &quot;Installing `pkg&#39;&quot;            cap ssc install `pkg&#39;        }    }Packages that are not on SSC may need to be net installed from other sources, including Github and personal websites. Again, this does not neatly work with a specific command check, and thus you may need to unconditionally install them. Use this code:    // If you have packages that need to be unconditionally installed from other sources (not SSC), then list them here.    // Example: grc1leg  net install grc1leg, from(&quot;http://www.stata.com/users/vwiggins/&quot;)    // Example when net install is not an option   cap mkdir &quot;$rootdir/ado/plus/e&quot;  cap copy http://www.sacarny.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ebayes.ado &quot;$rootdir/ado/plus/e/ebayes.ado&quot;Adding to replication packageThe following files should be included in your replication package:code/ado/*R packagesFor R packages, we suggest that users use renv, and do not set a specific CRAN mirror. We refer users to the renv documentation for details, but in a nutshell, for an existing R project that is not using renv, the following commands should be run in the R console:install.packages(&quot;renv&quot;)  # only oncerenv::init()               # only once per projectrenv::snapshot()           # only once per project, after all packages are installed. You should choose to install all packages detected, then snapshotting.renv::status()             # to check statusThis will create a file renv.lock in the top-level directory of your project.Adding to replication packageThe following files should be included in your replication package:.Rprofilerenv.lockrenv/activate.Rrenv/settings.jsonDo not include the entire renv directory, in particular not the renv/library subdirectory, as it is platform-specific (of no use to other platforms), and can be very large.Step 4: DisplaysDisplays (figures and tables) should be written out to external files, and the authors’ versions, as used in the manuscript, should be provided. In the prototypical replication package structure above, these files would be in the results directory.  Reference: https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/03-automatically_saving_figures.html and https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki/How-to-output-tables-and-figuresFigures  All figures can be written out to files. Journals like pdf and eps files, but png are convenient. You can output multiple formats.  Whenever you have displayed a figure, also exportit to a file. It’s a simple command.Stata// Example for PNGgraph export &quot;$rootdir/results/figure1.png&quot;, replace width(1200) height(800) // Example for PDFgraph export &quot;$rootdir/results/figure1.pdf&quot;, replaceR# Example for PNG if using standard Rpng(filename = file.path(rootdir, &quot;results&quot;, &quot;figure1.png&quot;), width = 1200, height = 800)plot(x, y)  # your plotting code heredev.off() # Example if using ggplot2ggsave(filename = file.path(rootdir, &quot;results&quot;, &quot;figure1.png&quot;), plot = myplot, width = 12, height = 8, units = &quot;in&quot;, dpi = 100)More complex figuresFor more complex figures, it may be easier to simply write out the data underlying the figure to an Excel sheet, and create the figure there. See https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki/How-to-output-tables-and-figures#arbitrary-data-to-excel  on how to write out the underlying data. You would then include the Excel file that maps the data into a figure with your replication package.TablesTables may be more complex. Simple tables can be written out using various tools:Stataesttab or outreg2, also putexcel. For fancier stuff, treat tables as data, use regsave or export excel to manipulate.Rxtable, stargazer, others.More complex tablesFor more complex tables, it may be easier to simply write out entire matrices, or individual numbers, to an Excel sheet, and compose the table there. See https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki/How-to-output-tables-and-figures#examples for an example, especially if you have already been compiling your tables in Excel. You would then include the Excel file that maps the data into your preferred table layout with your replication package.Step 5: Testing in containersAfter you have made all the above changes, you should test your code in an appropriate authorized container.  Reference: https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/80-docker.htmlThe following list of containers are authorized for testing, as they are reliably available, and achieve the desired transparency.  Install the software necessary for running containers.          For Windows, install Docker Desktop for Windows.      For Mac, install Docker Desktop for Mac or OrbStack.      For Linux, install Docker engine,  Podman, or use Apptainer. These can all also be installed on Windows under Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).        Use one of the following containers:          Stata containers for versions 19now back to 11, provided by the Social Science Data Editors at https://hub.docker.com/u/dataeditors, such as dataeditors/stata18_5-mp:2025-02-26.      R containers provided by the Rocker Project, such as rocker/r-ver:4.3.1 or rocker/tidyverse:4.3.1 (which includes the tidyverse packages).        When code has been adjusted as in Steps 1-4, no complex adjustment of containers is necessary.  Run the container, mounting your project directory into the container. For example, if your project is in /my/computer/users/me/project, you would use a command such as this (example for Stata):Preliminaries(may need some adjustment)VERSION=18_5TAG=2025-02-26MYHUBID=dataeditorsMYIMG=stata${VERSION}TYPE=mpSTATALIC=/path/to/your/stata/stata.licRun the containerdocker run -it --rm \  -v ${STATALIC}:/usr/local/stata/stata.lic \  -v $(pwd):/project \  -w /project \  $MYHUBID/${MYIMG}-${TYPE}:${TAG} -b main.doif using a Scenario B setup. If using a Scenario A setup, usedocker run -it --rm \  -v ${STATALIC}:/usr/local/stata/stata.lic \  -v $(pwd):/project \  -w /project/code \  $MYHUBID/${MYIMG}-${TYPE}:${TAG} -b main.doSuccessIf your code runs without error, and produces all expected output files, you are done! You can now submit your replication package to the Data Editor, along with the completed checklist from above, and the generated main.log as evidence.If your code does run into problems, the generated main.log should have clues as to what went wrong. You should be able to fix these issues, and re-run the code in the container, until it runs without error.Problems?If you run into problems in Step 5, no worries, simply submit all the files as modified in Steps 1-4, along with the completed checklist, and we will handle the remaining issues.            See the LDI Replication Lab’s setup here. &#8617;              A more customized setup might check for a package-specific file in the ado directory, such as the &lt;package&gt;.pkg, but this is more complex and may not always work. &#8617;      ">

  <p>The steps in this document are being used in a pilot project.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This document describes how to prepare your code for verification, taking into account some of the most frequent issues that the Data Editor and his team have encountered in submitted replication packages.</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>We will describe a few checks and edits you should make to your code, in order to ensure maximum reproducibility. We then describe how to test for reproducibility before submitting to the Data Editor. All steps have been tested by undergraduate replicators, and should be easy to implement. Whether they take a lot of time depends on your specific code, but generally, these adjustments can be made by somebody with good knowledge of the code base very quickly.</p>

<p>Much more extensive guidance on the issues addressed here is available at <a href="https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/">https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/</a>. We reference specific chapters there at each of the steps.</p>

<h3 id="preliminary-directory-structure-of-a-replication-package">Preliminary: Directory structure of a replication package</h3>

<p>A generic replication package, housed at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/my/computer/users/me/project</code>, might have the following structure:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>README.pdf

  figure2.pdf
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>where</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data/raw</code> has the externally acquired raw data files (not modified by the authors)</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data/analysis</code> has the processed data files, generated by the code in this repository.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code</code> has the code files.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">results</code> has all the results files.</li>
</ul>

<p>For illustration purposes, we have used Stata <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.do</code> files, and outputs in a variety of formats, but the same principles apply to other software, and to any output formats.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that we did not specify where the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.do</code> file will be!</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="step-1-main-file">Step 1: Main file</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>You may or may not have a main file. The following should be adapted to your circumstances. You do not need to create a file that is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.do</code> if you already have one, but you may need to update your existing main file.</p>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Creating a single main file is straightforward. However, you will want to make some minor edits depending on where, in the above template setup, the file is located:</p>

<h4 id="scenario-a-main-is-in-the-code-directory">Scenario A: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> is in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code</code> directory</h4>

<p>The most frequent scenario we see (which we call <strong>Scenario A</strong>) amongst economists is that the main file is in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code</code> directory:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>README.pdf
data/
...
code/
  main.do
  01_readcps.do
  02_readfred.do
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, the following generic main file will work: <sup id="fnref:scenarioa-main"><a href="#fn:scenarioa-main" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<div class="language-stata highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">local</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">scenario</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"A"</span><span class="w">          </span><span class="c1">// Scenario A: main is in code directory</span>

<h4 id="scenario-b-main-is-in-the-top-level-directory">Scenario B: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> is in the top-level directory</h4>

<p>More common in other computational sciences, but also present amongst economists, is that the main file is in the top-level directory:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>README.pdf
main.do
data/
...
code/
  01_readcps.do

<p>In this case, the following generic main file will work:</p>

<h4 id="important">Important</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>In neither scenario did we hard-code the path to our project directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/my/computer/users/me/project</code>. This is not an omission, and it is important, because it allows the code to be run on any computer, without modification.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="step-2-path-names">Step 2: Path names</h3>

<p>Windows computers use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\</code> (backslashes) in path names, while Mac and Linux computers use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> (forward slashes).</p>

<p>Two facts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Every statistical programming language can use generic path names using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> (forward slashes).</strong> This ensures wide reproducibility.</li>
  <li>The use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\</code> (backslashes) in path names breaks code on Mac and Linux computers.</li>
</ul>

<p>About 40% of replication packages in economics appear to be submitted by researchers using computers running MacOS or Linux. With a bit of simplified math, if we believe that is representative of what future replicators will do, that means that 40% of users will not be able to run 60% of replication packages without some potentially widespread edits, because of those backslashes.</p>

<p>You should thus replace all path names in your code to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> (forward slashes), or appropriate functions. This is straightforward:</p>

<p>In many cases, you can just globally replace all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> in your code files. Caution however is warranted if your code explicitly writes out $LaTeX$ code, which also (legitimately) uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\</code>. In that case, you will need to be more careful.</p>

<h4 id="expert-tip">Expert tip</h4>

<p>If using a (Bash or Zsh) terminal, you likely have the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sed</code> command available. You can use it to replace all backslashes with forward slashes in all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.do</code> files in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code</code> directory as follows:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sed</span> <span class="nt">-i</span> <span class="s1">'s+\\+/+g'</span> code/<span class="k">*</span>.do

<h3 id="step-3-dependencies">Step 3: Dependencies</h3>

<h4 id="stata-packages">Stata packages</h4>

<p>Stata users frequently use user-written packages, which are made available to the Stata community via the <a href="https://www.stata-journal.com/">Stata Journal</a>, <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/s/boc/bocode.html">SSC</a>, or Github. They are typically installed using a small number of variants of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">net install</code> command (including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssc install</code>).</p>

<p>Replicators need to have the same versions of these packages installed. Stata does not (currently) provide a way to install older versions of packages, and a regular occurrence of reproducibility failure is due to changes in packages over time. We have some simple solutions to this problem.</p>

<p>First, use an environment to permanently install-project specific packages once and for all.</p>

<p><strong>Define the environment</strong> in your main file, after setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$rootdir</code>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From this point on, all installed packages will be installed into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$rootdir/ado</code>, and Stata will look there first when loading packages.</p>

<p><strong>Install packages once</strong> if not present, but don’t reinstall if already present.</p>

<p><strong><em>Adding to replication package</em></strong></p>

<p>The following files should be included in your replication package:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>code/ado/<span class="k">*</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="r-packages">R packages</h4>

<p>For R packages, we suggest that users use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">renv</code>, and do not set a specific CRAN mirror. We refer users to the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html">renv documentation</a> for details, but in a nutshell, for an existing R project that is not using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">renv</code>, the following commands should be run in the R console:</p>

<div class="language-r highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">install.packages</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"renv"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="c1"># only once</span><span class="w">

</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will create a file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">renv.lock</code> in the top-level directory of your project.</p>

<p><strong><em>Adding to replication package</em></strong></p>

<p>The following files should be included in your replication package:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>.Rprofile
renv.lock
renv/activate.R
renv/settings.json
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Do not include the entire <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">renv</code> directory, in particular not the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">renv/library</code> subdirectory, as it is platform-specific (of no use to other platforms), and can be very large.</p>

<h3 id="step-4-displays">Step 4: Displays</h3>

<p>Displays (figures and tables) should be written out to external files, and the authors’ versions, as used in the manuscript, should be provided. In the prototypical replication package structure above, these files would be in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">results</code> directory.</p>

<p><em>More complex figures</em></p>

<p>For more complex figures, it may be easier to simply write out the data underlying the figure to an Excel sheet, and create the figure there. See <a href="https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki/How-to-output-tables-and-figures#arbitrary-data-to-excel">https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki/How-to-output-tables-and-figures#arbitrary-data-to-excel</a>  on how to write out the underlying data. <strong>You would then include the Excel file that maps the data into a figure with your replication package.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tables</strong></p>

<p>Tables may be more complex. Simple tables can be written out using various tools:</p>

<p><em>Stata</em></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">esttab</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">outreg2</code>, also <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">putexcel</code>. For fancier stuff, treat tables as data, use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">regsave</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">export excel</code> to manipulate.</p>

<p><em>R</em></p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xtable</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stargazer</code>, others.</p>

<p><em>More complex tables</em></p>

<p>For more complex tables, it may be easier to simply write out entire matrices, or individual numbers, to an Excel sheet, and compose the table there. See <a href="https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki/How-to-output-tables-and-figures#examples">https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/replicability-training/wiki/How-to-output-tables-and-figures#examples</a> for an example, especially if you have already been compiling your tables in Excel. <strong>You would then include the Excel file that maps the data into your preferred table layout with your replication package.</strong></p>

<h3 id="step-5-testing-in-containers">Step 5: Testing in containers</h3>

<p>After you have made all the above changes, you should test your code in an appropriate <strong>authorized</strong> container.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>The following list of containers are authorized for testing, as they are reliably available, and achieve the desired transparency.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Install the software necessary for running containers.
    <ul>
      <li>For Windows, install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/">Docker Desktop for Windows</a>.</li>
      <li>For Mac, install <a href="https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/">Docker Desktop for Mac</a> or <a href="https://orbstack.dev">OrbStack</a>.</li>
      <li>For Linux, install Docker engine,  <a href="https://podman.io/getting-started/installation">Podman</a>, or use <a href="https://apptainer.org/">Apptainer</a>. These can all also be installed on Windows under Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Use one of the following containers:
    <ul>
      <li>Stata containers for versions 19now back to 11, provided by the Social Science Data Editors at <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/dataeditors">https://hub.docker.com/u/dataeditors</a>, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dataeditors/stata18_5-mp:2025-02-26</code>.</li>
      <li>R containers provided by the <a href="https://www.rocker-project.org/">Rocker Project</a>, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rocker/r-ver:4.3.1</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rocker/tidyverse:4.3.1</code> (which includes the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tidyverse</code> packages).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>When code has been adjusted as in Steps 1-4, no complex adjustment of containers is necessary.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Run the container, mounting your project directory into the container. For example, if your project is in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/my/computer/users/me/project</code>, you would use a command such as this (example for Stata):</li>

<h3 id="success">Success</h3>

<p>If your code runs without error, and produces all expected output files, you are done! You can now submit your replication package to the Data Editor, along with the completed checklist from above, and the generated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.log</code> as evidence.</p>

<p>If your code does run into problems, the generated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.log</code> should have clues as to what went wrong. You should be able to fix these issues, and re-run the code in the container, until it runs without error.</p>

<h3 id="problems">Problems?</h3>

<p>If you run into problems in Step 5, no worries, simply submit all the files as modified in Steps 1-4, along with the completed checklist, and we will handle the remaining issues.</p>
