<meta name="description" content="The steps in this document are being used in a pilot project.   This document describes how to prepare your code for verification, taking into account some of the most frequent issues that the Data Editor and his team have encountered in submitted replication packages.  Overview  We will describe a few checks and edits you should make to your code, in order to ensure maximum reproducibility. We then describe how to test for reproducibility before submitting to the Data Editor. All steps have been tested by undergraduate replicators, and should be easy to implement. Whether they take a lot of time depends on your specific code, but generally, these adjustments can be made by somebody with good knowledge of the code base very quickly.  Much more extensive guidance on the issues addressed here is available at https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/. We reference specific chapters there at each of the steps.    Checklist  Print off (as PDF or on paper) the following checklist, and tick off each item as you complete it. Provide the completed checklist as part of the replication package.     Main file: A single main file is provided that runs all code.   Path names: All paths in code use / (forward slashes) relative to a single top-level project directory ($rootdir, $basedir, etc.)   Dependencies: All packages/libraries/dependencies are installed via code once.            For Stata, these packages are installed into a subdirectory in the project ($rootdir/ado, $basedir/adofiles, etc.), and used by the code.       For R, renv is used (exceptions made for other package management systems if such a system is explained).       For Python, environments are used (native venv or conda), and the necessary top-level requirements specified (no OS-specific dependencies are included).           Displays: All figures and tables are written out to clearly identified external files, and the authors’ versions, as used in the manuscript, are provided.   Testing in containers: After all changes were made, the code was run using an appropriate authorized container, and the generated log files are provided.       Detailed instructions  Preliminary: Directory structure of a replication package  A generic replication package, housed at /my/computer/users/me/project, might have the following structure:  README.pdf data/    raw/       cps0001.dat    analysis/       combined_data.dta       combined_data.csv       combined_data_codebook.pdf code/   01_readcps.do   02_readfred.do   03_table1-5.do   04_figures1-4.do results/   table1.tex   table2.xlsx   ...   figure1.png   figure2.pdf   where     data/raw has the externally acquired raw data files (not modified by the authors)   data/analysis has the processed data files, generated by the code in this repository.   code has the code files.   results has all the results files.   For illustration purposes, we have used Stata .do files, and outputs in a variety of formats, but the same principles apply to other software, and to any output formats.     Note that we did not specify where the main.do file will be!   Step 1: Main file     You may or may not have a main file. The following should be adapted to your circumstances. You do not need to create a file that is called main.do if you already have one, but you may need to update your existing main file.      Reference: https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/02-hands_off_running.html   Creating a single main file is straightforward. However, you will want to make some minor edits depending on where, in the above template setup, the file is located:  Scenario A: main is in the code directory  The most frequent scenario we see (which we call Scenario A) amongst economists is that the main file is in the code directory:  README.pdf data/ ... code/   main.do   01_readcps.do   02_readfred.do ...   In this case, the following generic main file will work: 1  local scenario &quot;A&quot;          // Scenario A: main is in code directory local pwd : pwd                     // This always captures the current directory  if &quot;`scenario&#39;&quot; == &quot;A&quot; {             // If in Scenario A, we need to change directory first     cd .. } global rootdir : pwd                // Now capture the directory to use as rootdir display in red &quot;Rootdir has been set to: $rootdir&quot; cd &quot;`pwd&#39;&quot;                            // Return to where we were before and never again use cd  // Now run the rest of the code do &quot;$rootdir/code/01_readcps.do&quot; do &quot;$rootdir/code/02_readfred.do&quot; do &quot;$rootdir/code/03_table1-5.do&quot; do &quot;$rootdir/code/04_figures1-4.do&quot;   Scenario B: main is in the top-level directory  More common in other computational sciences, but also present amongst economists, is that the main file is in the top-level directory:  README.pdf main.do data/ ... code/   01_readcps.do   02_readfred.do ...   In this case, the following generic main file will work:  local scenario &quot;B&quot;          // Scenario B: main is in project top-level directory local pwd : pwd                     // This always captures the current directory  if &quot;`scenario&#39;&quot; == &quot;A&quot; {             // If in Scenario A, we need to change directory first     cd .. } global rootdir : pwd                // Now capture the directory to use as rootdir display in red &quot;Rootdir has been set to: $rootdir&quot; cd &quot;`pwd&#39;&quot;                            // Return to where we were before and never again use cd  // Now run the rest of the code do &quot;$rootdir/code/01_readcps.do&quot; do &quot;$rootdir/code/02_readfred.do&quot; do &quot;$rootdir/code/03_table1-5.do&quot; do &quot;$rootdir/code/04_figures1-4.do&quot;   Important     In neither scenario did we hard-code the path to our project directory /my/computer/users/me/project. This is not an omission, and it is important, because it allows the code to be run on any computer, without modification.   Step 2: Path names  Windows computers use \ (backslashes) in path names, while Mac and Linux computers use / (forward slashes).  Two facts:     Every statistical programming language can use generic path names using / (forward slashes). This ensures wide reproducibility.   The use of \ (backslashes) in path names breaks code on Mac and Linux computers.   About 40% of replication packages in economics appear to be submitted by researchers using computers running MacOS or Linux. With a bit of simplified math, if we believe that is representative of what future replicators will do, that means that 40% of users will not be able to run 60% of replication packages without some potentially widespread edits, because of those backslashes.  You should thus replace all path names in your code to use / (forward slashes), or appropriate functions. This is straightforward:  Stata  // Instead of use &quot;data\analysis\combined_data.dta&quot;, clear // Use use &quot;data/analysis/combined_data.dta&quot;, clear // or better use &quot;$rootdir/data/analysis/combined_data.dta&quot;, clear   R  # Instead of data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data\\analysis\\combined_data.csv&quot;) # Use data &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/analysis/combined_data.csv&quot;) # or better data &lt;- read.csv(file.path(rootdir, &quot;data&quot;, &quot;analysis&quot;, &quot;combined_data.csv&quot;))   and similarly for other languages.  Implementing  In many cases, you can just globally replace all \ with / in your code files. Caution however is warranted if your code explicitly writes out $LaTeX$ code, which also (legitimately) uses \. In that case, you will need to be more careful.  Expert tip  If using a (Bash or Zsh) terminal, you likely have the sed command available. You can use it to replace all backslashes with forward slashes in all .do files in the code directory as follows:  sed -i &#39;s+\\+/+g&#39; code/*.do   Step 3: Dependencies  Stata packages  Stata users frequently use user-written packages, which are made available to the Stata community via the Stata Journal, SSC, or Github. They are typically installed using a small number of variants of the net install command (including ssc install).  Replicators need to have the same versions of these packages installed. Stata does not (currently) provide a way to install older versions of packages, and a regular occurrence of reproducibility failure is due to changes in packages over time. We have some simple solutions to this problem.  First, use an environment to permanently install-project specific packages once and for all.  Define the environment in your main file, after setting $rootdir:     Reference: https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/12-environments-in-stata.html and https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/template-config.do#L129   /* install any packages locally */ di &quot;=== Redirecting where Stata searches for ado files ===&quot; capture mkdir &quot;$rootdir/ado&quot; adopath - PERSONAL adopath - OLDPLACE adopath - SITE sysdir set PLUS     &quot;$rootdir/ado/plus&quot; sysdir set PERSONAL &quot;$rootdir/ado&quot;       // may be needed for some packages sysdir   From this point on, all installed packages will be installed into $rootdir/ado, and Stata will look there first when loading packages.  Install packages once if not present, but don’t reinstall if already present.     Reference: https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/template-config.do#L174   *** Add required packages from SSC to this list *** local ssc_packages &quot;&quot;     // Example:     // local ssc_packages &quot;estout boottest&quot;     //      display in red &quot;============ Installing packages/commands from SSC =============&quot;     display in red &quot;== Packages: `ssc_packages&#39;&quot;     if !missing(&quot;`ssc_packages&#39;&quot;) {         foreach pkg in `ssc_packages&#39; {             capture which `pkg&#39;             if _rc == 111 {                                 dis &quot;Installing `pkg&#39;&quot;                 ssc install `pkg&#39;             }             which `pkg&#39;         }     }   Some special cases (usually not necessary)  For some packages, the package name is not the same thing as the command name. Example: moremata. For these packages, the above code does not work. Use this code:2     Reference: https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/template-config.do#L187       // If you have packages that need to be unconditionally installed (the name of the package differs from the included commands), then list them here.     // examples are moremata, egennmore, blindschemes, etc. local ssc_unconditional &quot;&quot; /* add unconditionally installed packages */     display in red &quot;=============== Unconditionally installed packages from SSC ===============&quot;     display in red &quot;== Packages: `ssc_unconditional&#39;&quot;     if !missing(&quot;`ssc_unconditional&#39;&quot;) {         foreach pkg in `ssc_unconditional&#39; {             dis &quot;Installing `pkg&#39;&quot;             cap ssc install `pkg&#39;         }     }   Packages that are not on SSC may need to be net installed from other sources, including Github and personal websites. Again, this does not neatly work with a specific command check, and thus you may need to unconditionally install them. Use this code:      // If you have packages that need to be unconditionally installed from other sources (not SSC), then list them here.     // Example: grc1leg   net install grc1leg, from(&quot;http://www.stata.com/users/vwiggins/&quot;)     // Example when net install is not an option    cap mkdir &quot;$rootdir/ado/plus/e&quot;   cap copy http://www.sacarny.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ebayes.ado &quot;$rootdir/ado/plus/e/ebayes.ado&quot;   Adding to replication package  The following files should be included in your replication package:  code/ado/*   R packages  For R packages, we suggest that users use renv, and do not set a specific CRAN mirror. We refer users to the renv documentation for details, but in a nutshell, for an existing R project that is not using renv, the following commands should be run in the R console:  install.packages(&quot;renv&quot;)  # only once renv::init()               # only once per project renv::snapshot()           # only once per project, after all packages are installed. You should choose to install all packages detected, then snapshotting. renv::status()             # to check status   This will create a file renv.lock in the top-level directory of your project.  Adding to replication package  The following files should be included in your replication package:  .Rprofile renv.lock renv/activate.R renv/settings.json   Do not include the entire renv directory, in particular not the renv/library subdirectory, as it is platform-specific (of no use to other platforms), and can be very large.                 See the LDI Replication Lab’s setup here. &#8617;                 A more customized setup might check for a package-specific file in the ado directory, such as the &lt;package&gt;.pkg, but this is more complex and may not always work. &#8617;">

    <meta itemprop="description" content="  The steps in this document are being used in a pilot project.This document describes how to prepare your code for verification, taking into account some of the most frequent issues that the Data Editor and his team have encountered in submitted replication packages.OverviewWe will describe a few checks and edits you should make to your code, in order to ensure maximum reproducibility. We then describe how to test for reproducibility before submitting to the Data Editor. All steps have been tested by undergraduate replicators, and should be easy to implement. Whether they take a lot of time depends on your specific code, but generally, these adjustments can be made by somebody with good knowledge of the code base very quickly.Much more extensive guidance on the issues addressed here is available at https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/. We reference specific chapters there at each of the steps.ChecklistPrint off (as PDF or on paper) the following checklist, and tick off each item as you complete it. Provide the completed checklist as part of the replication package.  Main file: A single main file is provided that runs all code.  Path names: All paths in code use / (forward slashes) relative to a single top-level project directory ($rootdir, $basedir, etc.)  Dependencies: All packages/libraries/dependencies are installed via code once.          For Stata, these packages are installed into a subdirectory in the project ($rootdir/ado, $basedir/adofiles, etc.), and used by the code.      For R, renv is used (exceptions made for other package management systems if such a system is explained).      For Python, environments are used (native venv or conda), and the necessary top-level requirements specified (no OS-specific dependencies are included).        Displays: All figures and tables are written out to clearly identified external files, and the authors’ versions, as used in the manuscript, are provided.  Testing in containers: After all changes were made, the code was run using an appropriate authorized container, and the generated log files are provided.Detailed instructionsPreliminary: Directory structure of a replication packageA generic replication package, housed at /my/computer/users/me/project, might have the following structure:README.pdfdata/   raw/      cps0001.dat   analysis/      combined_data.dta      combined_data.csv      combined_data_codebook.pdfcode/  01_readcps.do  02_readfred.do  03_table1-5.do  04_figures1-4.doresults/  table1.tex  table2.xlsx  ...  figure1.png  figure2.pdfwhere  data/raw has the externally acquired raw data files (not modified by the authors)  data/analysis has the processed data files, generated by the code in this repository.  code has the code files.  results has all the results files.For illustration purposes, we have used Stata .do files, and outputs in a variety of formats, but the same principles apply to other software, and to any output formats.  Note that we did not specify where the main.do file will be!Step 1: Main file  You may or may not have a main file. The following should be adapted to your circumstances. You do not need to create a file that is called main.do if you already have one, but you may need to update your existing main file.  Reference: https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/02-hands_off_running.htmlCreating a single main file is straightforward. However, you will want to make some minor edits depending on where, in the above template setup, the file is located:Scenario A: main is in the code directoryThe most frequent scenario we see (which we call Scenario A) amongst economists is that the main file is in the code directory:README.pdfdata/...code/  main.do  01_readcps.do  02_readfred.do...In this case, the following generic main file will work: 1local scenario &quot;A&quot;          // Scenario A: main is in code directorylocal pwd : pwd                     // This always captures the current directoryif &quot;`scenario&#39;&quot; == &quot;A&quot; {             // If in Scenario A, we need to change directory first    cd ..}global rootdir : pwd                // Now capture the directory to use as rootdirdisplay in red &quot;Rootdir has been set to: $rootdir&quot;cd &quot;`pwd&#39;&quot;                            // Return to where we were before and never again use cd// Now run the rest of the codedo &quot;$rootdir/code/01_readcps.do&quot;do &quot;$rootdir/code/02_readfred.do&quot;do &quot;$rootdir/code/03_table1-5.do&quot;do &quot;$rootdir/code/04_figures1-4.do&quot;Scenario B: main is in the top-level directoryMore common in other computational sciences, but also present amongst economists, is that the main file is in the top-level directory:README.pdfmain.dodata/...code/  01_readcps.do  02_readfred.do...In this case, the following generic main file will work:local scenario &quot;B&quot;          // Scenario B: main is in project top-level directorylocal pwd : pwd                     // This always captures the current directoryif &quot;`scenario&#39;&quot; == &quot;A&quot; {             // If in Scenario A, we need to change directory first    cd ..}global rootdir : pwd                // Now capture the directory to use as rootdirdisplay in red &quot;Rootdir has been set to: $rootdir&quot;cd &quot;`pwd&#39;&quot;                            // Return to where we were before and never again use cd// Now run the rest of the codedo &quot;$rootdir/code/01_readcps.do&quot;do &quot;$rootdir/code/02_readfred.do&quot;do &quot;$rootdir/code/03_table1-5.do&quot;do &quot;$rootdir/code/04_figures1-4.do&quot;Important  In neither scenario did we hard-code the path to our project directory /my/computer/users/me/project. This is not an omission, and it is important, because it allows the code to be run on any computer, without modification.Step 2: Path namesWindows computers use \ (backslashes) in path names, while Mac and Linux computers use / (forward slashes).Two facts:  Every statistical programming language can use generic path names using / (forward slashes). This ensures wide reproducibility.  The use of \ (backslashes) in path names breaks code on Mac and Linux computers.About 40% of replication packages in economics appear to be submitted by researchers using computers running MacOS or Linux. With a bit of simplified math, if we believe that is representative of what future replicators will do, that means that 40% of users will not be able to run 60% of replication packages without some potentially widespread edits, because of those backslashes.You should thus replace all path names in your code to use / (forward slashes), or appropriate functions. This is straightforward:Stata// Instead ofuse &quot;data\analysis\combined_data.dta&quot;, clear// Useuse &quot;data/analysis/combined_data.dta&quot;, clear// or betteruse &quot;$rootdir/data/analysis/combined_data.dta&quot;, clearR# Instead ofdata &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data\\analysis\\combined_data.csv&quot;)# Usedata &lt;- read.csv(&quot;data/analysis/combined_data.csv&quot;)# or betterdata &lt;- read.csv(file.path(rootdir, &quot;data&quot;, &quot;analysis&quot;, &quot;combined_data.csv&quot;))and similarly for other languages.ImplementingIn many cases, you can just globally replace all \ with / in your code files. Caution however is warranted if your code explicitly writes out $LaTeX$ code, which also (legitimately) uses \. In that case, you will need to be more careful.Expert tipIf using a (Bash or Zsh) terminal, you likely have the sed command available. You can use it to replace all backslashes with forward slashes in all .do files in the code directory as follows:sed -i &#39;s+\\+/+g&#39; code/*.doStep 3: DependenciesStata packagesStata users frequently use user-written packages, which are made available to the Stata community via the Stata Journal, SSC, or Github. They are typically installed using a small number of variants of the net install command (including ssc install).Replicators need to have the same versions of these packages installed. Stata does not (currently) provide a way to install older versions of packages, and a regular occurrence of reproducibility failure is due to changes in packages over time. We have some simple solutions to this problem.First, use an environment to permanently install-project specific packages once and for all.Define the environment in your main file, after setting $rootdir:  Reference: https://larsvilhuber.github.io/self-checking-reproducibility/12-environments-in-stata.html and https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/template-config.do#L129/* install any packages locally */di &quot;=== Redirecting where Stata searches for ado files ===&quot;capture mkdir &quot;$rootdir/ado&quot;adopath - PERSONALadopath - OLDPLACEadopath - SITEsysdir set PLUS     &quot;$rootdir/ado/plus&quot;sysdir set PERSONAL &quot;$rootdir/ado&quot;       // may be needed for some packagessysdirFrom this point on, all installed packages will be installed into $rootdir/ado, and Stata will look there first when loading packages.Install packages once if not present, but don’t reinstall if already present.  Reference: https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/template-config.do#L174*** Add required packages from SSC to this list ***local ssc_packages &quot;&quot;    // Example:    // local ssc_packages &quot;estout boottest&quot;    //     display in red &quot;============ Installing packages/commands from SSC =============&quot;    display in red &quot;== Packages: `ssc_packages&#39;&quot;    if !missing(&quot;`ssc_packages&#39;&quot;) {        foreach pkg in `ssc_packages&#39; {            capture which `pkg&#39;            if _rc == 111 {                                dis &quot;Installing `pkg&#39;&quot;                ssc install `pkg&#39;            }            which `pkg&#39;        }    }Some special cases (usually not necessary)For some packages, the package name is not the same thing as the command name. Example: moremata. For these packages, the above code does not work. Use this code:2  Reference: https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/template-config.do#L187    // If you have packages that need to be unconditionally installed (the name of the package differs from the included commands), then list them here.    // examples are moremata, egennmore, blindschemes, etc.local ssc_unconditional &quot;&quot;/* add unconditionally installed packages */    display in red &quot;=============== Unconditionally installed packages from SSC ===============&quot;    display in red &quot;== Packages: `ssc_unconditional&#39;&quot;    if !missing(&quot;`ssc_unconditional&#39;&quot;) {        foreach pkg in `ssc_unconditional&#39; {            dis &quot;Installing `pkg&#39;&quot;            cap ssc install `pkg&#39;        }    }Packages that are not on SSC may need to be net installed from other sources, including Github and personal websites. Again, this does not neatly work with a specific command check, and thus you may need to unconditionally install them. Use this code:    // If you have packages that need to be unconditionally installed from other sources (not SSC), then list them here.    // Example: grc1leg  net install grc1leg, from(&quot;http://www.stata.com/users/vwiggins/&quot;)    // Example when net install is not an option   cap mkdir &quot;$rootdir/ado/plus/e&quot;  cap copy http://www.sacarny.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/ebayes.ado &quot;$rootdir/ado/plus/e/ebayes.ado&quot;Adding to replication packageThe following files should be included in your replication package:code/ado/*R packagesFor R packages, we suggest that users use renv, and do not set a specific CRAN mirror. We refer users to the renv documentation for details, but in a nutshell, for an existing R project that is not using renv, the following commands should be run in the R console:install.packages(&quot;renv&quot;)  # only oncerenv::init()               # only once per projectrenv::snapshot()           # only once per project, after all packages are installed. You should choose to install all packages detected, then snapshotting.renv::status()             # to check statusThis will create a file renv.lock in the top-level directory of your project.Adding to replication packageThe following files should be included in your replication package:.Rprofilerenv.lockrenv/activate.Rrenv/settings.jsonDo not include the entire renv directory, in particular not the renv/library subdirectory, as it is platform-specific (of no use to other platforms), and can be very large.            See the LDI Replication Lab’s setup here. &#8617;              A more customized setup might check for a package-specific file in the ado directory, such as the &lt;package&gt;.pkg, but this is more complex and may not always work. &#8617;      ">

  <p>You may or may not have a main file. The following should be adapted to your circumstances. You do not need to create a file that is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.do</code> if you already have one, but you may need to update your existing main file.</p>

<p>Creating a single main file is straightforward. However, you will want to make some minor edits depending on where, in the above template setup, the file is located:</p>

<h4 id="scenario-a-main-is-in-the-code-directory">Scenario A: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main</code> is in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code</code> directory</h4>

<p>The most frequent scenario we see (which we call <strong>Scenario A</strong>) amongst economists is that the main file is in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code</code> directory:</p>

<h4 id="important">Important</h4>

<blockquote>
  <p>In neither scenario did we hard-code the path to our project directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/my/computer/users/me/project</code>. This is not an omission, and it is important, because it allows the code to be run on any computer, without modification.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="step-2-path-names">Step 2: Path names</h3>

<p>Windows computers use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\</code> (backslashes) in path names, while Mac and Linux computers use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> (forward slashes).</p>

<p>Two facts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Every statistical programming language can use generic path names using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> (forward slashes).</strong> This ensures wide reproducibility.</li>
  <li>The use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\</code> (backslashes) in path names breaks code on Mac and Linux computers.</li>
</ul>

<p>About 40% of replication packages in economics appear to be submitted by researchers using computers running MacOS or Linux. With a bit of simplified math, if we believe that is representative of what future replicators will do, that means that 40% of users will not be able to run 60% of replication packages without some potentially widespread edits, because of those backslashes.</p>

<p>You should thus replace all path names in your code to use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> (forward slashes), or appropriate functions. This is straightforward:</p>

<h4 id="stata">Stata</h4>

<p>and similarly for other languages.</p>

<h4 id="implementing">Implementing</h4>

<p>In many cases, you can just globally replace all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\</code> with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code> in your code files. Caution however is warranted if your code explicitly writes out $LaTeX$ code, which also (legitimately) uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\</code>. In that case, you will need to be more careful.</p>

<h4 id="expert-tip">Expert tip</h4>

<p>If using a (Bash or Zsh) terminal, you likely have the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sed</code> command available. You can use it to replace all backslashes with forward slashes in all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.do</code> files in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code</code> directory as follows:</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">sed</span> <span class="nt">-i</span> <span class="s1">'s+\\+/+g'</span> code/<span class="k">*</span>.do
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="step-3-dependencies">Step 3: Dependencies</h3>

<h4 id="stata-packages">Stata packages</h4>

<p>Stata users frequently use user-written packages, which are made available to the Stata community via the <a href="https://www.stata-journal.com/">Stata Journal</a>, <a href="https://ideas.repec.org/s/boc/bocode.html">SSC</a>, or Github. They are typically installed using a small number of variants of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">net install</code> command (including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ssc install</code>).</p>

<p>Replicators need to have the same versions of these packages installed. Stata does not (currently) provide a way to install older versions of packages, and a regular occurrence of reproducibility failure is due to changes in packages over time. We have some simple solutions to this problem.</p>

<p>First, use an environment to permanently install-project specific packages once and for all.</p>

<p><strong>Define the environment</strong> in your main file, after setting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$rootdir</code>:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From this point on, all installed packages will be installed into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$rootdir/ado</code>, and Stata will look there first when loading packages.</p>

<p><strong>Install packages once</strong> if not present, but don’t reinstall if already present.</p>

<p>For R packages, we suggest that users use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">renv</code>, and do not set a specific CRAN mirror. We refer users to the <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html">renv documentation</a> for details, but in a nutshell, for an existing R project that is not using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">renv</code>, the following commands should be run in the R console:</p>
