To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.  Section 1 – Definitions.  (a)    Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.  (b)   Adapter&#39;s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.  (c)  Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.      (d) Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.    (e) Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.  (f) Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.  (g) Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.  (h) Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.  (i) Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.  (j) Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.  (k) You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.  Section 2 – Scope.  (a) License grant.    1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the   Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,   non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the   Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:      A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part;     and      B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.    2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where   Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does   not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and   conditions.            3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).      4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor   authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and   formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical   modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees   not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making   technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights,   including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective   Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply   making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces   Adapted Material.      5. Downstream recipients.              A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of       the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the       Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and       conditions of this Public License.              B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any       additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any       Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if       doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any       recipient of the Licensed Material.            6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may   be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that   Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,   endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others   designated to receive attribution as provided in Section   3(a)(1)(A)(i).  (b) Other rights.      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed   under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other   similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the   Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by   the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise   the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public   License.      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect   royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether   directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or   waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases   the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.  Section 3 – License Conditions.  Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.  (a) Attribution.    1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form),   You must:            A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the     Licensed Material:              i.   identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and       any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable       manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if       designated);              ii.  a copyright notice;              iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;              iv.  a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;              v.   a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent       reasonably practicable;          B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an     indication of any previous modifications; and          C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public     License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this     Public License.      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable   manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the   Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the   conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes   the required information.      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the   information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably   practicable.      4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter&#39;s License   You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from   complying with this Public License.  Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.  Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:  (a) for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;  (b) if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and  (c) You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.  Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.  (a) Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.  (b) To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.  (c) The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.  Section 6 – Term and Termination.  (a) This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.  (b) Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is   cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any   right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of   this Public License.  (c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.  (d) Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.  Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.  (a) The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.  (b) Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.  Section 8 – Interpretation.  (a) For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.  (b) To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.  (c) No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.  (d) Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.">

To the extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.  Section 1 – Definitions.  (a)    Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a moving image.  (b)   Adapter&#39;s License means the license You apply to Your Copyright and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.  (c)  Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.      (d) Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.    (e) Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

(g) Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.  (h) Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under this Public License.  (i) Share means to provide material to the public by any means or process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by them.  (j) Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.  (k) You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.  Section 2 – Scope.  (a) License grant.    1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the   Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,   non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the   Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:      A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part;     and      B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.    2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where   Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does   not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and   conditions.            3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).      4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.

The Licensor waives and/or agrees   not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making   technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights,   including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective   Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply   making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces   Adapted Material.      5. Downstream recipients.              A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of       the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the       Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and       conditions of this Public License.              B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any       additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any       Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if       doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any       recipient of the Licensed Material.            6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may   be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that   Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,   endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others   designated to receive attribution as provided in Section   3(a)(1)(A)(i).  (b) Other rights.      1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed   under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other   similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the   Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by   the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise   the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.      2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public   License.      3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect   royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether   directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or   waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases   the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.  Section 3 – License Conditions.  Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following conditions.  (a) Attribution.    1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form),   You must:            A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the     Licensed Material:              i.   identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and       any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable       manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if       designated);              ii.  a copyright notice;              iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;              iv.  a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;              v.   a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent       reasonably practicable;          B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an     indication of any previous modifications; and          C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public     License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this     Public License.      2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable   manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the   Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the   conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes   the required information.      3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the   information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably   practicable.      4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter&#39;s License   You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from   complying with this Public License.  Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.  Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:  (a) for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database;  (b) if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and  (c) You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.  Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.  (a) Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.  (b) To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.  (c) The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.  Section 6 – Term and Termination.  (a) This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.  (b) Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section 6(a), it reinstates:      1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is   cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or      2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any   right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of   this Public License.  (c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.  (d) Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.  Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.  (a) The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.  (b) Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.  Section 8 – Interpretation.  (a) For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under this Public License.  (b) To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.  (c) No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.  (d) Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction or authority.">

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of these
terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the Licensed
Material available under these terms and conditions.

Section 1 – Definitions.

(a)    Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in
which the Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged,
transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring permission
under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the Licensor. For
purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed Material is a
musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is
always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation
with a moving image.

(b)   Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

(c)  Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance,
broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without
regard to how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of
this Public License, the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not
Copyright and Similar Rights.
    
(d) Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty
adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.
  
(e) Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any
other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that
applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

(f) Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database, or
other material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

(g) Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the terms
and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all
Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed
Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

(h) Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
under this Public License.

(i) Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as
reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
available to the public including in ways that members of the public may
access the material from a place and at a time individually chosen by
them.

(j) Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the
Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, as
amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially equivalent rights
anywhere in the world.

(k) You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

Section 2 – Scope.

(a) License grant.

  1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the
  Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
  non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the
  Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

    A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part;
    and

    B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

  2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
  Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does
  not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and
  conditions.
        
  3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).
  
  4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The Licensor
  authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and
  formats whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical
  modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees
  not to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making
  technical modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights,
  including technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
  Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply
  making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces
  Adapted Material.
  
  5. Downstream recipients.
      
      A. Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material. Every recipient of
      the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
      Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and
      conditions of this Public License.
      
      B. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose any
      additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any
      Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if
      doing so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any
      recipient of the Licensed Material.
        
  6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may
  be construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that
  Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored,
  endorsed, or granted official status by, the Licensor or others
  designated to receive attribution as provided in Section
  3(a)(1)(A)(i).

(b) Other rights.
  
  1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed
  under this Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other
  similar personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the
  Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by
  the Licensor to the limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise
  the Licensed Rights, but not otherwise.
  
  2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public
  License.
  
  3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
  royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
  directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or
  waivable statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases
  the Licensor expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.

Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

(a) Attribution.

  1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form),
  You must:
      
    A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the
    Licensed Material:
      
      i.   identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and
      any others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable
      manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
      designated);
      
      ii.  a copyright notice;
      
      iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
      
      iv.  a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;
      
      v.   a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent
      reasonably practicable;
    
    B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an
    indication of any previous modifications; and
    
    C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public
    License, and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this
    Public License.
  
  2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable
  manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the
  Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
  conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes
  the required information.
  
  3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
  information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably
  practicable.
  
  4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License
  You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from
  complying with this Public License.

Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply
to Your use of the Licensed Material:

(a) for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to
extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the
contents of the database;

(b) if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents
in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the
database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its
individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

(c) You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all
or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

(a) Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the
extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and
as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory,
or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of title,
merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,
absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence
of errors, whether or not known or discoverable. Where disclaimers of
warranties are not allowed in full or in part, this disclaimer may not
apply to You.

(b) To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to
You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or
otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential,
punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages
arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even
if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such losses,
costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of liability is not
allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not apply to You.

(c) The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible,
most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all
liability.

Section 6 – Term and Termination.

(a) This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this
Public License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
automatically.

(b) Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
Section 6(a), it reinstates:
  
  1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is
  cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
  
  2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

  For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
  right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of
  this Public License.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the
Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this
Public License.

(d) Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

(a) The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms
or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

(b) Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of
the terms and conditions of this Public License.

Section 8 – Interpretation.

(a) For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall
not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on
any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without
permission under this Public License.

(b) To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum
extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be
reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License without affecting
the enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.

(c) No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
Licensor.

(d) Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as
a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that
apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any
jurisdiction or authority.
