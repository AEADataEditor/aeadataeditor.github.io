<meta name="description" content="This document describes how to best prepare a replication package for an AEA journal. Much of the guidance here is not specific to our journals - in fact, the document links to other websites for tutorials, best practices, etc. The best moment to do the preparation described here is, in fact, when you start the project, not once you have had your manuscript conditionally accepted. However, all steps here can and have been successfully performed at the point of conditional acceptance.  Key principle: Computational empathy          Keep in mind: The replication package is meant to be run by others, who have none of the setup, packages, and data that the original author might have, on computers that may not run the same operating system.     Treat the replication package as one of the methods to convey the methods that lead to your manuscript’s conclusions. Consider it a teaching tool, targeting young graduate students who may not be in your field.      Describing the contents of your replication package  Every replication package requires a document outlining where the data comes from, what data is provided, what requirements are needed to run the code in the replication package, how to run the code, what results to expect, and where to find the results. This is conventionally called the “README”.     The AEA requires that the README follow a prescribed schema.  Please use the template README for social science replication packages.     Follow the instructions within the template README, and provide it as part of your replication package.  Data Citations  All manuscripts will be checked for data citations. If you have not done so, now is the time to add them to your manuscript.  What to cite  All datasets actively used in your replication package that are not your own must be cited. Just as with any other literature, this serves to properly identify the provenance of the information you use, and attribution of credit to the original creator. Data you created should also be cited, either by pointing to a data deposit you made elsewhere, or by pointing to your own (forthcoming) data deposit at the AEA.     AEA Sample References   Guidance for data citations   Guidance on how to cite the data you collected   Some additional considerations   Where to cite  Every citation has an in-text entry (Smith (2020) or (Smith, 2020)), and a list entry in the Reference section (see the Chicago Manual of Style Quick Guide). This is true for data citations as well.     Your data citations should be listed in the Reference section of the manuscript.   In rare circumstances, when there are too many data citations to accomodate succinctly, data citations for sources can be deferred to an online data appendix. In all cases, for clarity, all data citations should also appear in the README, including with a separate Reference section.  Data citations and Data Availability Statements  In many cases, the data citation for a public-use dataset has a unique URL that is sufficient for downloading the dataset:     Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2000–2010. “Current Employment Statistics: Colorado, Total Nonfarm, Seasonally adjusted - SMS08000000000000001.” United States Department of Labor. http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?sm+08 (accessed February 9, 2011).   However, in many other cases where the URL does not lead directly to the dataset, a separate “Data Availability Statement” needs to be provided, as part of the README. A simple data citation is not sufficient. See general guidance on data availability statements, and some examples in the template README.  Ideal structure of a replication package  The AEA uses the openICPSR platform for replication packages. The platform allows users to download complete “deposits”, or only subdirectories thereof. However, deposits of replication packages at other trusted repositories are also accepted, as long as they satisfy the requirements described here.     Users must not upload ZIP packages as files - rather, ZIP files can be used to structure code and data, but should be unzipped on the platform (“import from ZIP”). The exception is when there are more than 1,000 files in the repository.   The code and data should run as downloaded from the repository, without further manual modifications (creating empty subdirectories programmatically is acceptable). Because code tends to be small, but data can be large, we strongly advise to not commingle data and code - interested researchers can download  the code directory by itself if they wish, without also downloading a potentially very large data directory.  A simple template might be README.pdf data/    raw/       cps0001.dat    analysis/       combined_data.dta       combined_data.csv       combined_data_codebook.pdf code/   01_create/       01_readcps.R       02_readfred.R   02_analysis/       01_table1-5.R       02_figures1-4.R results/   table1.tex   table2.tex   ...   figure1.pdf   figure2.pdf   No manual modifications  The replication package should reproduce the tables and figures, as well as any in-text numbers, by running code without manual intervention.     The only exception to this rule is a single change to set a small number of program and data directory paths.   While running a small number of distinct programs separately  is acceptable (in some cases even desirable), it is not acceptable to require replicators to manually enter numbers, or configure parameter files, in order to reproduce the tables and figures in the paper. Nevertheless, it should be clear from the manuscript and the code how a replicator might deviate from the tables and figures in the paper.  Structure in the presence of more than 1,000 files  As of 2021, ICPSR cannot accept deposits with more than 1,000 files. Therefore, we relax the rule that all data and code must be unzipped, though we still insist on the “smallest possible configuration”.  In most cases, it is a particular directory that is the primary culprit. Say you have  Structure-pre: /code: 20 files /data/    src1/: 25 files    src2/: 101 files    src3/: 3,000 files   then the ideal structure, taking into account the 1,000 file limit, would be:  Structure-post: /code: 20 files /data/    src1/: 25 files    src2/: 101 files    src3.zip: = 1 file, containing 3,000 files  (src3/ and its 3,000 files have been removed!)  Your README should provide instructions to the replicators how to recover the fully unzipped structure (there are cross-platform differences in unzipping, so be precise about the final structure, rather than the method of getting there).  Alternatively, the code can handle the unzipping - optional, but more robust.  Once you’ve adjusted that, zip up the whole structure (so a ZIP file that has inside it another zip file, plus the /code, /data/src1/, and /data/src2/ directories), and “Import from ZIP” when uploading to ICPSR.  See also a similar entry to our FAQ.  Structure in the presence of confidential (unpublished) data  When the replication package relies on confidential data that cannot be shared, or is shared under different conditions, authors will have to     prepare a confidential (partial) replication package            this would contain the contents of data/confidential and possibly data/conf_analysis from the example below.           preserve (archive) the confidential replication package            If the data cannot be removed from a secure enclave, they should nevertheless be archived wherever the confidential data are kept (see this FAQ)       If the data can be shared, but are subject to access restrictions, follow  this guide on creating a separate data deposit and, when creating the restricted deposit at ICPSR, follow these instructions on how to do so.           prepare a non-confidential replication package that contains all code, and any data that is not subject to publication controls            this would contain the contents of data/raw, data/analysis, code/, and for reference, results/ from the example below.           ensure that replicators have detailed instructions on how to combine the two packages   specify  which (if any) of the results in their paper can be reproduced without the confidential data.   Clearly separate the restricted from the open-access data, both in terms of the raw data as well as the processed data:  data/    raw/       cps0001.dat    confidential/       ssa.csv    conf_analysis/       confidential_combined.dta   Keep in mind that you may be able to provide a subset of your replication package privately to the AEA Data Editor, see  the Sharing restricted-access data with the AEA Data Editor page, or that you might be able to create a separate data deposit with a more limited license.  Authors might want to investigate the  possibility of providing “fake” or “simulated” data that might allow replicators to run code, without necessarily obtaining meaningful results (functionality test).     The Social Science Editors’ FAQ describes a related issue.   Considering the replicator  The replicator of your package is likely to be less qualified than you are. After all, you are publishing something novel.  You should assume     that the replicator has basic knowledge in how to run your software package, if the software is commonly used in economics            Stata, Matlab, some others are commonly used       Compiled or new computer languages are much less likely to be widely used, even if they are used in your subdiscipline             You can assume     that the replicator can manipulate a top-level configuration file            for instance, to set a base directory       but not setting a base directory at the top of 25 different files           You should NOT assume     that the replicator will use the same type of operating system            describe any hard requirements, but do not impose any fake requirements       most Stata, Matlab, SAS, R, Python, etc. can run on any operating system, unless you hard-code platform-specific commands into your code           that the replicator has any of your packages/modules/etc. installed            provide a setup program to install these (not manual instructions).       provide copies of such packages/modules when the package repository does not allow you to specify a version       provide a container/ Docker image/ VM that comprises all the necessary software and libraries           that the replicator will run the software the same way you do            some software can be run in different ways (interactive, batch, etc.) and may behave differently depending on how it s run.       For instance, Stata will change the working directory to that of the program being run in batch mode, but not if running interactively       For instance, running R code using Rstudio may behave differently than running it with rscript           For less frequently used software, provide a URL where the software can be obtained.     essentially, if not listed in the figure above, provide information on how to obtain software   if using commercial compilers, we also suggest to compile your code using open-source or free compilers (including any free performance packages, such as Intel MKL), even if the resulting code is not the most efficient.   as of 2021, the AEA Data Editor has access to the software on this list, and any open-source (free) software that can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS.   Choosing a license  By default, the openICPSR deposit attributes a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License to your deposit, but you can choose a different license. If you do, you must add a file called “LICENSE.txt” (by convention capitalized) to the deposit.     See our Licensing guidance for more details.   Re-run your replication package  Ideally, once you have prepared your replication package, you should re-run the code again, in a clean environment, possibly a fresh computer, to ensure that (a) the package is, in fact, reproducible with minimal interaction (b) the results are numerically identical.     Wherever possible, we strongly encourage running in batch (non-interactive) mode.   Preparing to upload  Once you are done preparing your replication package, you should upload it:     if you have received a conditional acceptance, your replication  package must be in a trusted repository. The default trusted repository is the AEA Data and Code Repository. Other trusted repositories are acceptable (see list), but replication packages should meet the display guidelines.   if you have confidential data that you want to transmit to the AEA Data Editor but do not want published, communicate with the AEA Data Editor directly (see this FAQ and Sharing restricted-access data with the AEA Data Editor).   if you have received instructions during the revise-and-resubmit process to have a reproducibility check conducted, you may use the AEA Data and Code Repository, but other methods are also acceptable. Do not forget, however, that once the paper is accepted, it must be made available on a trusted repository - other methods are then no longer acceptable.   Final checklist  Before proceeding, do check:     you have prepared a README that provides all the relevant information, as per the README template   your manuscript includes data citations   your data and code deposit contains all code, including code to read in raw data, even when the data cannot be provided.   your replication package has been re-executed, and reproduces the tables and figures in your manuscript faithfully.   Next step  If you are ready, you can proceed to upload to the AEA Data and Code Repository.">

A simple template might be README.pdf data/    raw/       cps0001.dat    analysis/       combined_data.dta       combined_data.csv       combined_data_codebook.pdf code/   01_create/       01_readcps.R       02_readfred.R   02_analysis/       01_table1-5.R       02_figures1-4.R results/   table1.tex   table2.tex   ...   figure1.pdf   figure2.pdf   No manual modifications  The replication package should reproduce the tables and figures, as well as any in-text numbers, by running code without manual intervention.     The only exception to this rule is a single change to set a small number of program and data directory paths.   While running a small number of distinct programs separately  is acceptable (in some cases even desirable), it is not acceptable to require replicators to manually enter numbers, or configure parameter files, in order to reproduce the tables and figures in the paper. Nevertheless, it should be clear from the manuscript and the code how a replicator might deviate from the tables and figures in the paper.  Structure in the presence of more than 1,000 files  As of 2021, ICPSR cannot accept deposits with more than 1,000 files. Therefore, we relax the rule that all data and code must be unzipped, though we still insist on the “smallest possible configuration”.  In most cases, it is a particular directory that is the primary culprit. Say you have  Structure-pre: /code: 20 files /data/    src1/: 25 files    src2/: 101 files    src3/: 3,000 files   then the ideal structure, taking into account the 1,000 file limit, would be:  Structure-post: /code: 20 files /data/    src1/: 25 files    src2/: 101 files    src3.zip: = 1 file, containing 3,000 files  (src3/ and its 3,000 files have been removed!)  Your README should provide instructions to the replicators how to recover the fully unzipped structure (there are cross-platform differences in unzipping, so be precise about the final structure, rather than the method of getting there).  Alternatively, the code can handle the unzipping - optional, but more robust.  Once you’ve adjusted that, zip up the whole structure (so a ZIP file that has inside it another zip file, plus the /code, /data/src1/, and /data/src2/ directories), and “Import from ZIP” when uploading to ICPSR.  See also a similar entry to our FAQ.  Structure in the presence of confidential (unpublished) data  When the replication package relies on confidential data that cannot be shared, or is shared under different conditions, authors will have to     prepare a confidential (partial) replication package            this would contain the contents of data/confidential and possibly data/conf_analysis from the example below.           preserve (archive) the confidential replication package            If the data cannot be removed from a secure enclave, they should nevertheless be archived wherever the confidential data are kept (see this FAQ)       If the data can be shared, but are subject to access restrictions, follow  this guide on creating a separate data deposit and, when creating the restricted deposit at ICPSR, follow these instructions on how to do so.           prepare a non-confidential replication package that contains all code, and any data that is not subject to publication controls            this would contain the contents of data/raw, data/analysis, code/, and for reference, results/ from the example below.           ensure that replicators have detailed instructions on how to combine the two packages   specify  which (if any) of the results in their paper can be reproduced without the confidential data.   Clearly separate the restricted from the open-access data, both in terms of the raw data as well as the processed data:  data/    raw/       cps0001.dat    confidential/       ssa.csv    conf_analysis/       confidential_combined.dta   Keep in mind that you may be able to provide a subset of your replication package privately to the AEA Data Editor, see  the Sharing restricted-access data with the AEA Data Editor page, or that you might be able to create a separate data deposit with a more limited license.  Authors might want to investigate the  possibility of providing “fake” or “simulated” data that might allow replicators to run code, without necessarily obtaining meaningful results (functionality test).     The Social Science Editors’ FAQ describes a related issue.   Considering the replicator  The replicator of your package is likely to be less qualified than you are. After all, you are publishing something novel.  You should assume     that the replicator has basic knowledge in how to run your software package, if the software is commonly used in economics            Stata, Matlab, some others are commonly used       Compiled or new computer languages are much less likely to be widely used, even if they are used in your subdiscipline             You can assume     that the replicator can manipulate a top-level configuration file            for instance, to set a base directory       but not setting a base directory at the top of 25 different files           You should NOT assume     that the replicator will use the same type of operating system            describe any hard requirements, but do not impose any fake requirements       most Stata, Matlab, SAS, R, Python, etc. can run on any operating system, unless you hard-code platform-specific commands into your code           that the replicator has any of your packages/modules/etc. installed            provide a setup program to install these (not manual instructions).       provide copies of such packages/modules when the package repository does not allow you to specify a version       provide a container/ Docker image/ VM that comprises all the necessary software and libraries           that the replicator will run the software the same way you do            some software can be run in different ways (interactive, batch, etc.) and may behave differently depending on how it s run.       For instance, Stata will change the working directory to that of the program being run in batch mode, but not if running interactively       For instance, running R code using Rstudio may behave differently than running it with rscript           For less frequently used software, provide a URL where the software can be obtained.     essentially, if not listed in the figure above, provide information on how to obtain software   if using commercial compilers, we also suggest to compile your code using open-source or free compilers (including any free performance packages, such as Intel MKL), even if the resulting code is not the most efficient.   as of 2021, the AEA Data Editor has access to the software on this list, and any open-source (free) software that can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS.   Choosing a license  By default, the openICPSR deposit attributes a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License to your deposit, but you can choose a different license. If you do, you must add a file called “LICENSE.txt” (by convention capitalized) to the deposit.     See our Licensing guidance for more details.   Re-run your replication package  Ideally, once you have prepared your replication package, you should re-run the code again, in a clean environment, possibly a fresh computer, to ensure that (a) the package is, in fact, reproducible with minimal interaction (b) the results are numerically identical.     Wherever possible, we strongly encourage running in batch (non-interactive) mode.   Preparing to upload  Once you are done preparing your replication package, you should upload it:     if you have received a conditional acceptance, your replication  package must be in a trusted repository. The default trusted repository is the AEA Data and Code Repository. Other trusted repositories are acceptable (see list), but replication packages should meet the display guidelines.   if you have confidential data that you want to transmit to the AEA Data Editor but do not want published, communicate with the AEA Data Editor directly (see this FAQ and Sharing restricted-access data with the AEA Data Editor).   if you have received instructions during the revise-and-resubmit process to have a reproducibility check conducted, you may use the AEA Data and Code Repository, but other methods are also acceptable. Do not forget, however, that once the paper is accepted, it must be made available on a trusted repository - other methods are then no longer acceptable.   Final checklist  Before proceeding, do check:     you have prepared a README that provides all the relevant information, as per the README template   your manuscript includes data citations   your data and code deposit contains all code, including code to read in raw data, even when the data cannot be provided.   your replication package has been re-executed, and reproduces the tables and figures in your manuscript faithfully.   Next step  If you are ready, you can proceed to upload to the AEA Data and Code Repository.">

    <meta itemprop="headline" content="Preparing your files for verification">
    <meta itemprop="description" content="This document describes how to best prepare a replication package for an AEA journal. Much of the guidance hereis not specific to our journals - in fact, the document links to other websites for tutorials, best practices, etc. The best moment to do the preparation described here is, in fact, when you start the project, not once you have had your manuscript conditionally accepted. However, all steps here can and have been successfully performed at the point of conditional acceptance.Key principle: Computational empathy      Keep in mind: The replication package is meant to be run by others, who have none of the setup, packages, and data that the original author might have, on computers that may not run the same operating system.    Treat the replication package as one of the methods to convey the methods that lead to your manuscript’s conclusions. Consider it a teaching tool, targeting young graduate students who may not be in your field.  Describing the contents of your replication packageEvery replication package requires a document outlining where the data comes from, what data is provided, what requirements are needed to run the code in the replication package, how to run the code, what results to expect, and where to find the results. This is conventionally called the “README”.  The AEA requires that the README follow a prescribed schema.  Please use the template README for social science replication packages.Follow the instructions within the template README, and provide it as part of your replication package.Data CitationsAll manuscripts will be checked for data citations. If you have not done so, now is the time to add them to yourmanuscript.What to citeAll datasets actively used in your replication package that are not your own must be cited. Just as with any other literature, this serves to properly identify the provenance of the information you use, and attribution of credit to the original creator. Data you created should also be cited, either by pointing to a data deposit you made elsewhere, or by pointing to your own (forthcoming) data deposit at the AEA.  AEA Sample References  Guidance for data citations  Guidance on how to cite the data you collected  Some additional considerationsWhere to citeEvery citation has an in-text entry (Smith (2020) or (Smith, 2020)), and a list entry in the Reference section (see the Chicago Manual of Style Quick Guide). This is true for data citations as well.  Your data citations should be listed in the Reference section of the manuscript.In rare circumstances, when there are too many data citations to accomodate succinctly, data citations for sources can be deferred to an online data appendix. In all cases, for clarity, all data citations should also appear in the README, including with a separate Reference section.Data citations and Data Availability StatementsIn many cases, the data citation for a public-use dataset has a unique URL that is sufficient for downloading the dataset:  Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2000–2010. “Current Employment Statistics: Colorado, Total Nonfarm, Seasonally adjusted - SMS08000000000000001.” United States Department of Labor. http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?sm+08 (accessed February 9, 2011).However, in many other cases where the URL does not lead directly to the dataset, a separate “Data Availability Statement” needs to be provided, as part of the README. A simple data citation is not sufficient. See general guidance on data availability statements, and some examples in the template README.Ideal structure of a replication packageThe AEA uses the openICPSR platform for replication packages. The platform allows users to download complete “deposits”, or only subdirectories thereof. However, deposits of replication packages at other trusted repositories are also accepted, as long as they satisfy the requirements described here.  Users must not upload ZIP packages as files - rather, ZIP files can be used to structure code and data, but should be unzipped on the platform (“import from ZIP”). The exception is when there are more than 1,000 files in the repository.The code and data should run as downloaded from the repository, without further manual modifications (creating empty subdirectories programmatically is acceptable). Because code tends to be small, but data can be large, we strongly advise to not commingle data and code - interested researchers can download  the code directory by itself if they wish, without also downloading a potentially very large data directory.A simple template might beREADME.pdfdata/   raw/      cps0001.dat   analysis/      combined_data.dta      combined_data.csv      combined_data_codebook.pdfcode/  01_create/      01_readcps.R      02_readfred.R  02_analysis/      01_table1-5.R      02_figures1-4.Rresults/  table1.tex  table2.tex  ...  figure1.pdf  figure2.pdfNo manual modificationsThe replication package should reproduce the tables and figures, as well as any in-text numbers, by running code without manual intervention.  The only exception to this rule is a single change to set a small number of program and data directory paths.While running a small number of distinct programs separately  is acceptable (in some cases even desirable), it is not acceptable to require replicators to manually enter numbers, or configure parameter files, in order to reproduce the tables and figures in the paper.

        <p>This document describes how to best <strong>prepare a replication package</strong> for an AEA journal. Much of the guidance here
is not specific to our journals - in fact, the document links to other websites for tutorials, best practices, etc. The best moment to do the preparation described here is, in fact, when you start the project, not once you have had your manuscript conditionally accepted. However, all steps here can and have been successfully performed at the point of conditional acceptance.</p>

<h3 id="key-principle-computational-empathy">Key principle: Computational empathy</h3>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep in mind: The replication package is meant to be run by others, who have none of the setup, packages, and data that the original author might have, on computers that may not run the same operating system.</li>
    <li>Treat the replication package as one of the methods to convey the methods that lead to your manuscript’s conclusions. Consider it a teaching tool, targeting young graduate students who may not be in your field.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="describing-the-contents-of-your-replication-package">Describing the contents of your replication package</h3>

<p>Every replication package requires a document outlining where the data comes from, what data is provided, what requirements are needed to run the code in the replication package, how to run the code, what results to expect, and where to find the results. This is conventionally called the “README”.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The AEA requires that the README follow a prescribed schema.  Please use the <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/">template README for social science replication packages</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/template-readme-700x433.png" alt="template README" /></p>

<p>Follow the instructions within the template README, and provide it as part of your replication package.</p>

<h3 id="data-citations">Data Citations</h3>

<p>All manuscripts will be checked for data citations. If you have not done so, now is the time to add them to your
manuscript.</p>

<h4 id="what-to-cite">What to cite</h4>

<p>All datasets actively used in your replication package that are not your own must be cited. Just as with any other literature, this serves to properly identify the provenance of the information you use, and attribution of credit to the original creator. Data you created should also be cited, either by pointing to a data deposit you made elsewhere, or by pointing to your own (forthcoming) data deposit at the AEA.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/sample-references">AEA Sample References</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/addtl-data-citation-guidance.html">Guidance for data citations</a></li>
  <li><a href="data-deposit-aea.html#citing-your-deposit">Guidance on how to cite the data you collected</a></li>
  <li><a href="/posts/2021-03-31-what-data">Some additional considerations</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="where-to-cite">Where to cite</h4>

<p>Every citation has an in-text entry (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Smith (2020)</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(Smith, 2020)</code>), and a list entry in the Reference section (see the <a href="https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-2.html">Chicago Manual of Style Quick Guide</a>). This is true for data citations as well.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your data citations should be listed in the <strong>Reference section</strong> of the <strong>manuscript</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In rare circumstances, when there are too many data citations to accomodate succinctly, data citations for sources can be deferred to an online data appendix. In all cases, for clarity, all data citations should <strong>also</strong> appear in the <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/template-README.html">README</a>, including with a separate <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/template-README.html#references">Reference section</a>.</p>

<h4 id="data-citations-and-data-availability-statements">Data citations and Data Availability Statements</h4>

<p>In many cases, the data citation for a public-use dataset has a unique URL that is sufficient for downloading the dataset:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bureau of Labor Statistics. 2000–2010. “Current Employment Statistics: Colorado, Total Nonfarm, Seasonally adjusted - SMS08000000000000001.” <em>United States Department of Labor</em>. http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?sm+08 (accessed February 9, 2011).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, in many other cases where the URL does not lead directly to the dataset, a separate “Data Availability Statement” needs to be provided, as part of the README. A simple data citation is not sufficient. See <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information_dcas.html">general guidance on data availability statements</a>, and <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/template-README.html#data-availability-and-provenance-statements">some examples in the template README</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ideal-structure-of-a-replication-package">Ideal structure of a replication package</h3>

<p>The AEA uses the openICPSR platform for replication packages. The platform allows users to download complete “deposits”, or only subdirectories thereof. However, deposits of replication packages at other trusted repositories are also accepted, as long as they satisfy the requirements described here.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Users must not upload ZIP packages as files - rather, ZIP files can be used to structure code and data, but should be unzipped on the platform (“import from ZIP”). The exception is when there are <a href="#structure-in-the-presence-of-more-than-1000-files">more than 1,000 files in the repository</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The code and data should run as downloaded from the repository, without further manual modifications (creating empty subdirectories programmatically is acceptable). Because code tends to be small, but data can be large, we strongly advise to not commingle data and code - interested researchers can download  the code directory by itself if they wish, without also downloading a potentially very large data directory.</p>

<p>A simple template might be</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>README.pdf
data/
   raw/
      cps0001.dat
   analysis/
      combined_data.dta
      combined_data.csv
      combined_data_codebook.pdf
code/
  01_create/
      01_readcps.R
      02_readfred.R
  02_analysis/
      01_table1-5.R
      02_figures1-4.R
results/
  table1.tex
  table2.tex
  ...
  figure1.pdf
  figure2.pdf
</code></pre></div></div>

<h4 id="no-manual-modifications">No manual modifications</h4>

<p>The replication package should reproduce the tables and figures, as well as any in-text numbers, by <strong>running code without manual intervention</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The only exception to this rule is a single change to set a small number of program and data directory paths.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While running a small number of distinct programs separately  is acceptable (in some cases even desirable), it is <strong>not acceptable</strong> to require replicators to manually enter numbers, or configure parameter files, in order to reproduce the tables and figures in the paper. Nevertheless, it should be clear from the manuscript and the code how a replicator might deviate from the tables and figures in the paper.</p>

<h4 id="structure-in-the-presence-of-more-than-1000-files">Structure in the presence of more than 1,000 files</h4>

<p>As of 2021, ICPSR cannot accept deposits with more than 1,000 files. Therefore, we relax the rule that all data and code must be unzipped, though we still insist on the “smallest possible configuration”.</p>

<p>In most cases, it is a particular directory that is the primary culprit. Say you have</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Structure-pre:</code></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/code: 20 files
/data/
   src1/: 25 files
   src2/: 101 files
   src3/: 3,000 files
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>then the ideal structure, taking into account the 1,000 file limit, would be:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Structure-post:</code></p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>/code: 20 files
/data/
   src1/: 25 files
   src2/: 101 files
   src3.zip: = 1 file, containing 3,000 files
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>(src3/ and its 3,000 files have been removed!)</p>

<p>Your README should provide instructions to the replicators how to recover the fully unzipped structure (there are cross-platform differences in unzipping, so be precise about the final structure, rather than the method of getting there).</p>

<p>Alternatively, the code can handle the unzipping - optional, but more robust.</p>

<p>Once you’ve adjusted that, zip up the whole structure (so a ZIP file that has inside it another zip file, plus the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/code</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/data/src1/</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/data/src2/</code> directories), and “Import from ZIP” when uploading to ICPSR.</p>

<h4 id="structure-in-the-presence-of-confidential-unpublished-data">Structure in the presence of confidential (unpublished) data</h4>

<p>When the replication package relies on confidential data that cannot be shared, or is shared under different conditions, authors will have to</p>

<ul>
  <li>prepare a confidential (partial) replication package
    <ul>
      <li>this would contain the contents of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data/confidential</code> and possibly <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data/conf_analysis</code> from the example below.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>preserve (archive) the confidential replication package
    <ul>
      <li>If the data cannot be removed from a secure enclave, they should nevertheless be archived wherever the confidential data are kept (see <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/FAQ.html#how-can-i-ensure-that-the-confidential-data-is-preserved">this FAQ</a>)</li>
      <li>If the data can be shared, but are subject to access restrictions, follow  <a href="creating-separate-data-deposit">this guide on creating a separate data deposit</a> and, when creating the restricted deposit at ICPSR, follow <a href="creating-restricted-data-deposit-icpsr">these instructions on how to do so</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>prepare a non-confidential replication package that contains all code, and any data that is not subject to publication controls
    <ul>
      <li>this would contain the contents of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data/raw</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data/analysis</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code/</code>, and for reference, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">results/</code> from the example below.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>ensure that replicators have detailed instructions on how to combine the two packages</li>
  <li>specify  which (if any) of the results in their paper can be reproduced without the confidential data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clearly separate the restricted from the open-access data, both in terms of the raw data as well as the processed data:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>data/
   raw/
      cps0001.dat
   confidential/
      ssa.csv
   conf_analysis/
      confidential_combined.dta
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Keep in mind that you may be able to provide a subset of your replication package privately to the AEA Data Editor, see  the <a href="sharing-restricted-data">Sharing restricted-access data with the AEA Data Editor</a> page, or that you might be able to <a href="creating-separate-data-deposit">create a separate data deposit</a> with a more <a href="Licensing_guidance">limited license</a>.</p>

<p>Authors might want to investigate the  possibility of providing “fake” or “simulated” data that might allow replicators to run code, without necessarily obtaining meaningful results (functionality test).</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/FAQ.html#i-use-confidential-data-i-am-allowed-to-provide-the-data-to-the-data-editor-for-the-purpose-of-replication-but-you-are-not-allowed-to-publish-the-data-how-do-i-proceed">Social Science Editors’ FAQ</a> describes a related issue.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="considering-the-replicator">Considering the replicator</h4>

<p>The replicator of your package is likely to be less qualified than you are. After all, you are publishing something novel.</p>

<p>You should assume</p>

<ul>
  <li>that the replicator has basic knowledge in how to run your software package, if the software is commonly used in economics
    <ul>
      <li>Stata, Matlab, some others are commonly used</li>
      <li>Compiled or new computer languages are much less likely to be widely used, even if they are used in your subdiscipline</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/figure_software_years_pct.png" alt="software usage" /></p>

<p>You can assume</p>

<ul>
  <li>that the replicator can manipulate a top-level configuration file
    <ul>
      <li>for instance, to set a base directory</li>
      <li>but not setting a base directory at the top of 25 different files</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>You should NOT assume</p>

<ul>
  <li>that the replicator will use the same type of operating system
    <ul>
      <li>describe any <em>hard</em> requirements, but do not impose any <em>fake</em> requirements</li>
      <li>most Stata, Matlab, SAS, R, Python, etc. can run on any operating system, unless you hard-code platform-specific commands into your code</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>that the replicator has any of your packages/modules/etc. installed
    <ul>
      <li>provide a setup program to install these (not manual instructions).</li>
      <li>provide copies of such packages/modules when the package repository does not allow you to specify a version</li>
      <li>provide a container/ Docker image/ VM that comprises all the necessary software and libraries</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>that the replicator will run the software the same way you do
    <ul>
      <li>some software can be run in different ways (interactive, batch, etc.) and may behave differently depending on how it s run.</li>
      <li>For instance, Stata will change the working directory to that of the program being run in batch mode, but not if running interactively</li>
      <li>For instance, running R code using Rstudio may behave differently than running it with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rscript</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For less frequently used software, provide a URL where the software can be obtained.</p>

<ul>
  <li>essentially, if not listed in the figure above, provide information on how to obtain software</li>
  <li>if using commercial compilers, we also suggest to compile your code using open-source or free compilers (including any free performance packages, such as Intel MKL), even if the resulting code is not the most efficient.</li>
  <li>as of 2021, the AEA Data Editor has access to the software on <a href="https://ciser.cornell.edu/computing/computing-account-software/">this list</a>, and any open-source (free) software that can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="choosing-a-license">Choosing a license</h3>

<p>By default, the openICPSR deposit attributes a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License</a> to your deposit, but you can choose a different license. If you do, you must add a file called “LICENSE.txt” (by convention capitalized) to the deposit.</p>

<ul>
  <li>See our <a href="Licensing_guidance">Licensing guidance</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="re-run-your-replication-package">Re-run your replication package</h3>

<p>Ideally, once you have prepared your replication package, you should re-run the code again, in a clean environment, possibly a fresh computer, to ensure that (a) the package is, in fact, reproducible with minimal interaction (b) the results are numerically identical.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wherever possible, we strongly encourage running in batch (non-interactive) mode.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="preparing-to-upload">Preparing to upload</h3>

<p>Once you are done preparing your replication package, you should upload it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>if you have received a conditional acceptance, your replication  package <strong>must</strong> be in a trusted repository. The default trusted repository is the <a href="https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/search/aea/studies">AEA Data and Code Repository</a>. Other trusted repositories are acceptable (see <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information_hosting.html#trusted-repositories">list</a>), but replication packages should meet the <a href="guidelines-other-repositories">display guidelines</a>.</li>
  <li>if you have confidential data that you want to transmit to the AEA Data Editor but do not want published, communicate with the AEA Data Editor directly (see <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/faq#restricted">this FAQ</a> and <a href="sharing-restricted-data">Sharing restricted-access data with the AEA Data Editor</a>).</li>
  <li>if you have received instructions during the revise-and-resubmit process to have a reproducibility check conducted, you may use the AEA Data and Code Repository, but other methods are also acceptable. Do not forget, however, that once the paper is accepted, it <strong>must</strong> be made available on a trusted repository - other methods are then no longer acceptable.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="final-checklist">Final checklist</h3>

<p>Before proceeding, do check:</p>

<ul class="task-list">
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />you have prepared a README that provides all the relevant information, as per the <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/">README template</a></li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />your manuscript includes data citations</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />your data and code deposit contains all code, including code to read in raw data, <em>even when the data cannot be provided</em>.</li>
  <li class="task-list-item"><input type="checkbox" class="task-list-item-checkbox" disabled="disabled" />your replication package has been re-executed, and reproduces the tables and figures in your manuscript faithfully.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="next-step">Next step</h3>

<p>If you are ready, you can proceed to <a href="data-deposit-aea">upload to the AEA Data and Code Repository</a>.</p>
