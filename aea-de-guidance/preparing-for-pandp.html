README Content  The README content must contain all the required elements as per the AEA Data and Code Availability Policy.

Code  Deposits must always contain code, even if data cannot be included. The provided code must be complete, including for construction  of the analysis data from raw data, and for appendix tables and  figures, and all inline numbers.  Data  Please only include data that you are allowed to publish. The README should provide instructions for any data that you are not allowed to publish. For large deposits, contact the AEA Data Editor. Maximum of 20GB.
