But it also acknowledges that there are cases where data cannot be shared. This may be due to privacy concerns, proprietary rights to the data that are not the author’s, or terms of use that prohibit the sharing, redistribution, or publication of data.</p>

<p>So what happens when an author inadvertently does share such data, and the data provider finds out, and is not happy? Let’s call this a “take-down request.” The data provider asks that the author remove the data from the replication package. But the author is committed (by <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/forms/data-code-archive-agreement">signing an agreement</a>) to not withdrawing the replication package. How to proceed? Read on!</p>

<h2 id="in-a-nutshell">In a nutshell</h2>

<p>The gist of the solution is the following, for AEA manuscripts (which I obviously know well), but probably similarly for other journals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remove the infringing data from V1 of the replication package.</li>
  <li>[Ideally] Create a new, separate deposit that is in compliance with the data provider’s terms of use.</li>
  <li>Document the new location of the now absent data in the README of the replication package.</li>
  <li>Submit the revised replication package to the journal.</li>
  <li>The journal publishes V2 of the replication package, which is now compliant.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="an-example-psid-data">An example: PSID data</h2>

<p>For years, I as Data Editor have alerted authors when I detected data that infringes on terms of use. Two of the most frequent cases are the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and the UNSD’s Comtrade data. We even have an <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/faq#psid">FAQ entry dedicated to the PSID case</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/sample-language-report.md?plain=1#L243">copy-and-paste entry in our “most frequent errors” document</a>.</p>

<p>But what if PSID data does end up in a deposit, either because I missed it (believe it or not, I’m not perfect), or because the replication package was published before the Data Editor was appointed?<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> In fact, on November 1, 2024, the folks at PSID did just that: Contacted a large number of authors that had included PSID data in their replication packages, asking them to remove the data.</p>

<p>It is worth reminding that the <a href="https://simba.isr.umich.edu/U/CondUse.aspx">PSID terms of use</a>, which everybody agrees to when downloading the data, are quite clear:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>Not transfer PSID public data that has been downloaded from the website, including user-created data extracts, to any third parties…</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>So what can authors do?</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="preliminary-steps">Preliminary steps</h3>

<p>The first steps involve getting access to your own replication package. This may differ by when the replication package was published.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<ul>
  <li>For authors with papers published before 2019 (approximately)
    <ul>
      <li>All authors will need to get an openICPSR login, which will serve them both for the changes to the AEA and for creating the new PSID deposit.</li>
      <li>They will need to request access to the deposit. The <a href="https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/contactUs">openICPSR helpdesk</a> may be able to help with that. The authors should mention the URL or DOI, and the openICPSR login they want the deposit associated with.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For authors with more recent papers:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>They will need to re-create an ICPSR account <strong>with the same email as previously used</strong> since <a href="https://researcherpassport.icpsr.umich.edu/help">ICPSR changed their login system in Feb 2024</a>. The <a href="https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/contactUs">openICPSR helpdesk</a> may help with that.</li>
      <li>They need to then <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/revisions-policy#createnewversion">create a new version</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/icpsr-create-new-version.png" alt="Create a new version" />]</p>

<h3 id="rules-that-apply-to-revisions-of-replication-packages">Rules that apply to revisions of replication packages</h3>

<p>Here are a few simple rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The modified package should differ only as necessary from the original package. Less work for the author, greater clarity for replicators, everybody wins.</li>
  <li>Journal-specific policies may apply. For instance, the AEA has a <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/revisions-policy">Policy on Revisions of Data and Code Deposits in the AEA Data and Code Repository</a>. Among other things, it requires that all changes be clearly identified.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fixing-the-problem">Fixing the problem</h3>

<p>Once the preliminaries are done, here’s what authors need to do to remain compliant with AEA policy (similar rules may apply at other journals):</p>

<ul>
  <li>PSID actually has a way to properly and openly preserve the user-created extracts in compliance with their terms of use. It is the <a href="https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/psid">PSID Repository on openICPSR</a>.</li>
  <li>For sake of discussion, the “original replication package” is V1. The replacement replication package will be V2.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/psid-repository.png" alt="Image of PSID repository" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>For sake of discussion, consider the case where V1 contains a single file <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">psid.dta</code>.</li>
  <li>Authors should <a href="https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/psid/deposit-instructions">create a new deposit at the PSID repository</a> with title “Supplementary data for: [NAME OF THE MANUSCRIPT]”.
    <ul>
      <li>Put into it ONLY the PSID data <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">psid.dta</code>.</li>
      <li>You might want to add the DOI of V1 and the DOI of the manuscript in the “Related publications” section.</li>
      <li>Publish it.</li>
      <li>Remember the DOI (not the URL). Call this the “PSID DOI”.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Log on to the V1 deposit. You should be in “Modifying” mode.</li>
  <li>Remove (delete) the same PSID data you just uploaded into the PSID deposit, from the openICPSR AEA deposit V1.</li>
  <li>Update the README with “PSID data for this package can be obtained from [PSID DOI]” in an appropriate location. The ideal README follows the <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7293838">Template README published by the Social Science Data Editors</a>, but make only minimal changes to the README in this deposit. Delete the old README (<em>completely</em>), upload the new README (in PDF format).</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/revisions-policy#identifying">Create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CHANGES.txt</code>.</a>  Identify changes made. E.g. “V2: Moved PSID data to [PSID DOI]”. Upload the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CHANGES.txt</code>.</li>
  <li>(Optional) Link to the PSID DOI in the “Related publications” section of the deposit.</li>
  <li><a href="https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/data-deposit-aea.html#submitting-to-the-data-editor">Re-Submit to the AEA</a></li>
  <li>Contact the <a href="https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/contactUs">openICPSR helpdesk</a> and ask them to “Unpublish” the V1 deposit.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/project-submit.png" alt="(Re-)Submit to the AEA" /></p>

<h3 id="the-end-state">The end state</h3>

<p>After all the fixes,</p>

<ul>
  <li>V1 is still visible, but can no longer be downloaded.</li>
  <li>the PSID deposit is now available. Users who want to download the data have to agree to the PSID’s terms of use. You are now in compliance with the PSID’s terms of use!</li>
  <li>V2 is published, contains no PSID data, links to the PSID deposit, and remains otherwise available to replicators. You are still in compliance with the AEA publication agreements and your obligations as an AEA author!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The problem outlined above is not unique to the PSID. We have seen “takedown” requests from the German Socio-Economic Panel and others, and I have prevented inadvertent publication of UNSD Comtrade data, Compustat data, commercial data, PII-laden data, etc. The PSID is relatively unique in that it has a mechanism to actually preserve the author-created extracts. A few other such mechanisms exist, but they are by no means universal. Most “takedown” requests can only be satisfied with the deletion of data, and the inclusion of detailed information on how others can obtain the data from the original data provider - an error-prone and not ideal process.</p>

<p>Authors should feel free to reach out to their journal’s data and reproducibility editor with questions about the available options.</p>

Some folks do this for robustness checks - same data, different analysis method, or a variant of the dependent variable - others for simulation of various scenarios - an economy without banks, an economy with credit-constrained banks, an economy with unconstrained banks. I won’t point to particular examples, to protect the (somewhat) innocent, but this is not a good idea.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>It introduces lots of failure points - not necessarily in the final package, but in the development process.</p>

<h2 id="the-example">The example</h2>

<p>Consider that you are halfway through your project. You have a base model, and three variants thereof. Each of which is the base model, copied into three different directories, with minimal modifications in the code. For sake of clarity, and with no loss of generality intended:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>code/
    base-model/
            base-model.m
    robustness-check-1/
            base-model.m
    robustness-check-2/
            base-model.m
    robustness-check-3/
            base-model.m
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>where a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">diff</code> between <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">base-model.m</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">robustness-check-1/base-model.m</code> would show only a few lines changed:</p>

<div class="language-diff highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gh">diff code/base-model/base-model.m code/robustness-check-1/base-model.m
</span><span class="p">13073c13073
</span><span class="gd">&lt; a=1;
</span><span class="p">---
</span><span class="gi">&gt; a=2;
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note: the change would appear to be in line 13073, which is awfully subtle… this is inspired by real-life examples!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>Now imagine that your thesis advisor, or a reviewer, identifies a key problem in the implemented algorithm. You fix it in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">base-model.m</code>, but now need to fix it in all the other modified copies too. Will there be any typos when you implement the patch? What if there are not three robustness checks, but 30? Or 300 different parameterizations of a simulation?</p>

<p>The techy programmer might decide to do this with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">patch</code> in conjunction with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git</code>, but that already counts as advanced functionality (I probably lost a lot of readers with the first part of that sentence…)</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c"># create a patch from the updates to the base model</span>
git diff d362f6..3bd22 <span class="o">&gt;</span> patch.diff
<span class="c"># apply the patch to the robustness check</span>
patch code/robustness-check-1/base-model.m &lt; patch.diff
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>but that is not a robust solution that scales to the 30 or 300 robustness checks.</p>

<h2 id="a-possible-solution">A possible solution</h2>

<p>The core solution is to apply elementary best programming practices: <strong>write functions</strong>.<sup id="fnref:functions" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:functions" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>So should one go about the above problem? My rule of thumb is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Copy code once, fine, don’t do it again.</li>
  <li>Copy it twice, stop, and create a function.</li>
  <li>Copy it three times: don’t even go there!</li>
</ul>

<p>Assuming that you are using MATLAB (where we seem to see this often), you should treat the core model code as a “function” (even if you do not explicitly program it that way), and then call that “function” multiple times. In a nutshell:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>code/
    core-simulation/
            parametrized-simulation.m
    base-model.m
    robustness-check-1.m
    robustness-check-2.m
    robustness-check-3.m
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>where</p>

<div class="language-matlab highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">% base-model.m</span>

<span class="c1">% We set the base model to have the following parameters,</span>
<span class="c1">% as per Section 2 of the paper:</span>
<span class="n">a</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">b</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">c</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="c1">% We then call the core simulation code</span>
<span class="n">parametrized</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">simulation</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>will call the code in “parametrized-simulation.m” with parameters <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a,b,c</code> already set. The simulation itself assumes those parameters are set.<sup id="fnref:proper-function" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:proper-function" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The robustness checks might then have</p>

<div class="language-matlab highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">% robustness-check-1.m</span>

<span class="c1">% We set the model to have the following parameters,</span>
<span class="c1">% as per Section 3 of the paper:</span>

<span class="n">a</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">% This differs from the base model</span>
<span class="n">b</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">c</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="c1">% We then call the core simulation code</span>
<span class="n">parametrized</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">simulation</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>or go through a loop of multiple values:</p>

<div class="language-matlab highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">% robustness-check-2.m</span>


<span class="c1">% We set the model to have the following parameters,</span>
<span class="c1">% as per Section 4 of the paper:</span>

<span class="n">b</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">c</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="c1">% We now explore the space of a within this context.</span>

<span class="k">end</span>

<span class="c1">% Summarize results from exploration</span>

<span class="n">summarize</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">results</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="other-languages">Other languages</h2>

<p>Is that a MATLAB-specific problem? No. We see similar issues in Stata, R, Python, and other languages. The core solution is the same: write functions, and call them multiple times, instead of copying code around, and hard-coding parameters.</p>

<h2 id="other-situations">Other situations</h2>

<p>The above example had continuous (well, kind of) parameter spaces. What if they are discontinuous? You can still loop over a whole set of specifications by storing them in a file - yes, an Excel file is fine! - and reading them in (in MATLAB, <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/import_export/ways-to-import-spreadsheets.html"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">readtable</code></a>). For example,</p>

<div class="language-matlab highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c1">% Read the Excel spreadsheet</span>

In a nutshell, just because you are able to freely use the data for your own research purposes does not give you the right to distribute the data to others. The devil is in the details.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="a-scenario">A scenario</h2>

<p>You are happily browsing along the internet, and find an fabulous dataset you think you can use for your awesome idea. Download, analyze, submit, publish, … all good. But then the pesky journal asks for a replication package. Easy, right? Wrap up the code, the data, upload, … all good? Maybe. Possibly not.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>Many data used by economists stems from other data sources. Most of these data sources are on the internet. Anybody can use data that’s on the internet and do with it what they want, right?</p>

<p>As the discussion surrounding copyright and artificial intelligence shows, the answer is complex.<sup id="fnref:nytai" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:nytai" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:silverman" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:silverman" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> There is a concept of “fair use” in US copyright law, and in particular, it has been used to allow for legal webscraping.<sup id="fnref:webscraping" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:webscraping" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>But that applies primarily for “use”. If you want to publish the data you obtained from elsewhere, that is no longer necessarily considered (fair) “use”, it falls under “redistribution” or “publication”.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>

<p>In principle, the solution is for data providers to establish clear terms of use and licenses. And many do, especially in the commercial space. In general, you will find that “terms of use” restrict certains uses and rights, and “licenses” allow or grant certain uses and rights.</p>

<p>Historically, it was software that was licensed, and “open source” licenses have a long history. Many such licenses are listed at the “<a href="https://opensource.org/licenses">open source initiative</a>”.</p>

<p>For data, a popular set of licenses are the “<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">Creative Commons</a>” licenses. These licenses are designed to be easy to understand and to use, and allow for a wide range of uses - including <strong>redistribution</strong>. The CC-BY license is abundantly clear about what it allows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC By 4.0 DEED</a>:</p>

  <p>You are free to:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Share — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially. 
[…]</li>
  </ul>

</blockquote>

<p>Other data licenses exist that allow for redistribution explicitly:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/">Open Data Commons Open Database License (ODbL)</a></li>
  <li>various government “open data” licenses, such as the <a href="https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/">UK Open Government License</a> and Statistics Canada’s <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/reference/licence">Statistics Canada Open Licence</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>(often times, the differences are minor between these licenses).</p>

<h2 id="the-problem-part-2">The problem, part 2</h2>

<p>The problem is that many (academic) data providers still do not show or apply these licenses, and have no terms of use, or ones that are hidden. It thus becomes difficult for researchers to know what they can and cannot do with the data they find, leading to avoidable confusion.</p>

<p>Sometimes, these are identified at the time of downloading the data. For instance, the widely-used <a href="https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/WVSDocumentationWV6.jsp">World Values Survey</a> displays four conditions to researchers who (after registering) download the data:</p>

<p><img src="/images/wvs-download-screenshot-20240429.png" alt="WVS download conditions" /></p>

<p>It otherwise mentions the “non-redistribution license” or that “data redistribution is prohibited” in multiple places, but there is no single “Terms of Use” page, or a “WVS License” page that is easily accessible and referenceable.</p>

<p>Even when terms of use are provided, permissions and restrictions are not necessarily linked together. For instance, the fabulous <a href="https://dhsprogram.com/">DHS Program</a> states on many of its pages</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The DHS Program is authorized to distribute, at no cost, unrestricted survey data files for legitimate academic research.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>but one has to search for the <a href="https://dhsprogram.com/data/Terms-of-Use.cfm">Terms of Use</a>, tucked in between “Contraceptive Calendar Tutorial” and “DHS Github Code Share”, which state (also very clearly)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Conditions of Use for The DHS Program datasets 
(applies to all datasets downloaded from The DHS Program website: www.dhsprogram.com)</p>

  <p>[…]</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Agree that the datasets <strong>will not be shared</strong> with other researchers without the written consent of The DHS Program.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>(emphasis added). Many researchers include DHS data in their replication packages, and active data editors like myself have to remind them to remove the data from the replication package.</p>

<h2 id="the-takeaways">The takeaways</h2>

<h3 id="data-providers">Data providers</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Data providers should have a clear “Terms of Use” page, or a “License” page, that is easily accessible and referenceable.</li>
  <li>They should also include the license and conditions in every download.</li>
  <li>When data formats that allow for annotation (Stata, SAS), embed the license information in the dataset itself.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="researchers">Researchers</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Always record the terms of use and license when you download the data.</li>
  <li>Search for “terms of use” or “license” on data providers’ websites.</li>
  <li>If the website asks for registration, it is highly likely that there are redistribution restrictions.</li>
  <li>Request that data providers make their terms of use and licenses more visible and accessible.</li>
  <li>Consult (and update) the <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/reference/TermsOfUse.html">Social Science Data Editors’ Terms of Use database</a>.</li>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>

<p>The data, and sometimes (only sometimes) pieces of code, are confidential. If this is something you encounter, read on.</p>

<h2 id="this-is-not-new">This is not new</h2>

<p>See my <a href="https://aeadataeditor.github.io/posts/2022-04-13-coding-confidential">earlier post almost exactly two years ago</a> and this <a href="https://larsvilhuber.github.io/reproducibility-confidential-fsrdc/">2022 tutorial</a> that I developed from that.</p>

<p>and the <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/copies/Fort2016-Readme.pdf">copy of the README</a>.</p>

<p>Note that this package was created before the installation of the current generation of data editors, so relied on none of that (official) expertise!</p>

<p>Many more out there.</p>

<h2 id="ask-the-research-data-center">Ask the research data center</h2>

<p>The US Census Bureau has procedures in place to review code (it’s actually part of the release system), as do many other systems. Some parts of the code will need to be redacted, but you can get very functional code released (see the <a href="https://larsvilhuber.github.io/reproducibility-confidential-fsrdc/">2022 tutorial</a> on how to set this up from the start).</p>

<h2 id="but-dont-take-no-for-an-answer">But: Don’t take “No” for an answer!</h2>

<p>There are sometimes some old practices in place in restricted-access environments that do not have 100s of researchers flowing through (for instance, smaller countries, places with newer centers, etc.). Sometimes, you need to push back. You can rely on the Data Editors - me, others - to help you do that. I have successfully educated data custodians, who justifiably fear releasing too much confidential data, on what can be done reliably and robustly, at least with code.</p>

<h2 id="dotting-the-is-and-crossing-the-ts">Dotting the i’s and crossing the t’s</h2>

<p>We usually require that an <strong>internal</strong> archive be created at the institution holding the data, so that regardless of how much or how little is released, internally, a fully reproducible archive exists, accessible for those with permission to access.

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] the data are from a commercial company under a non-disclosure agreement […] asked to include “data sharing plans (for all data, documentation, and code used in analysis)”.

<p>(paraphrased)</p>

<p>The use of some sort of data access restriction is quite common in economics. We have a few examples listed <a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information_dcas.html">here</a>. 
None of those directly address when an NDA is required, but the generic “<a href="https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Requested_information_dcas.html#example-for-confidential-data">confidential data</a>” example is straightforward to adapt.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The data for this project are confidential, but may be obtained with Data Use Agreements with the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE). Researchers interested in access to the data may contact [NAME] at [EMAIL], also see www.doe.mass.edu/research/contact.html. It can take some months to negotiate data use agreements and gain access to the data. The author will assist with any reasonable replication attempts for two years following publication.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As general guidance, journal (data) editors seek the following information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>how did the author access the data? (describe how the initial contact was made, what type of agreements, such as NDAs, were signed, and what they restrict and why)</li>
  <li>how can others​ access the data? (“Contact the vice president of academic interaction, and request “data on gooble-dee-gooks” from 2002-2022.”) Importantly, the author should address whether the exact data can be obtained by others, or if this was a pull from a dynamic database, and while generically the same data might be available in a few years’ time, the exact data will never be obtainable. Or that after 10 years, regulatory requirements force the data provider to delete the data. Or whatever is needed to assess the likelihood of being able to access such data. Costs and delays are also important.</li>
  <li>In some cases, authors may already know that the regime within the data provider has changed in such a fashion that the data are no longer available to anybody going forward - that may not be an impediment for the paper being published, but it is important to know (the data are fundamentally unverifiable)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is summarized in the Data and Code Availability Standard, that many econ journals now adhere to: <a href="https://datacodestandard.org/">https://datacodestandard.org/</a></p>

<p>I will note that in many of these cases, the files were made available to the journal’s Data Editor (=me) under a derivative or implicit NDA, allowing the journal to verify veracity of the analysis, despite the data not being publishable. In cases where the source cannot be named, the Data Editor may enter into an NDA with the author to learn the name of the source, to verify plausibility, without revealing the information publicly. While all of these are second-best access methods, they are far better than obscurity and opacity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Econ and finance journals are getting their acts together wrt reproducibility.  A bigger issue now is data acquired via NDAs. I wish it were normal for NDAs to have a clause letting third parties replicate results on an air-gapped machine.</p>

  <p>Don’t know how to make it happen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few thoughts.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="ndas-with-clauses">NDAs with clauses</h2>

<p>I have started to see researchers incorporate such clauses into NDAs. Very rare, but possible. More generally, certain NDAs allow to add “third parties” to an existing contract - no special clause necessary, but researchers must be aware of the possibility.</p>

<h2 id="ndas-without-clauses">NDAs without clauses</h2>

<p>In some cases, no additional clause is needed. Read the NDA carefully: can you assign a new member of the research team (e.g., a new RA at your co-author’s university) to the contract, with minor hassles (simple notification)? Yes? Then you can probably also assign a journal verifier to the contract! Verifiers can be the “RA” on the contract, and can obtain the data (compliant with any other access restrictions). In many cases, authors have then been able to provide us with a non-publishable extract of the same data, for the duration of the verification process. We can sign a NDA with the authors, if needed, but most are fine with an email promise to delete the data. Our process is outlined <a href="https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/sharing-restricted-data">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="journal-verifiers-with-access">Journal verifiers with access</h2>

<p>Another thing is that in some cases, as long as both the authors and the verifiers are (separately) subscribers, data may be able to be shared. But caution: not every “subscription” is the same. For instance, when researchers use WRDS data, they cannot directly share the data. In principle, I should be able to access the same data sources - as <a href="https://johnson.library.cornell.edu/database/wharton-research-data-services-wrds/">Cornell is also a subscriber</a>. But WRDS subscriptions have a huge menu of sub-options. The researcher may be able to access WRDS <a href="https://github.com/chrisconlon/CommonOwnerReplication/blob/master/code/1_Download_WRDS_Data.py">via the Python API</a>, but as it turns out, my subscription does not extend to that!<sup id="fnref:conlon" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:conlon" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="journal-verifiers-acquiring-access">Journal verifiers acquiring access</h2>

<p>In some cases, there is a <strong>generalized access mechanism</strong>. Thus, while the researcher cannot share the data with us, because the DUA or NDA does not allow for it, it is relatively straightforward for the journal verifier to obtain access. For instance,</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/default.aspx">PSID</a> (see <a href="https://simba.isr.umich.edu/U/CondUse.aspx">Conditions of use</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.worldvaluessurvey.org/wvs.jsp">World Values Survey</a> (WVS)</li>
  <li><a href="https://dhsprogram.com/">Demographic and Health Surveys</a> (DHS) (note banner at <a href="https://dhsprogram.com/data/dataset_admin/login_main.cfm">Data Download site</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.678568.en/research_data_center_soep.html">German Socio-Economic Panel</a> (SOEP) (see <a href="https://www.diw.de/en/diw_01.c.601584.en/data_access.html#c_741347">Data Access rules</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>all do not allow for redistribution of the data, even of their “publicly accessible” data.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hint: if there is a login, a checkbox, or something else you need to click on in order to download the data, it is very likely that you cannot simply re-publish (distribute, post) the data (but that is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But in all three cases, the journal verifier can obtain access to the data, and verify the replication package.</p>

<p>Some of these mechanisms have easy ways for researchers to make re-acquiring the data easy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>PSID offers both the ability to <a href="https://simba.isr.umich.edu/DC/c.aspx">share “carts”</a> and to deposit extracts in a compliant way at the <a href="">PSID repository</a></li>
  <li>SOEP assigns DOI to datasets, allowing to ask for the exact same dataset. See <a href="https://doi.org/10.5684/soep.v35.1">https://doi.org/10.5684/soep.v35.1</a> for an example.</li>
</ul>

<p>While a bit of a hassle, this does allow journals to obtain the same data. Note that this is not always easy or possible: for instance, if the original author used the SOEP data in Europe, they will have had a different access than my US-based team will have, because non-European users only get access to a 95% sample.</p>

<p>Also, Cornell has so far not been able to agree to the terms of use required to even sign a data use agreement, something about GDPR etc… So what do we do then?</p>

<h2 id="using-third-party-verifiers-with-access">Using third party verifiers with access</h2>

<p>When NDAs or DUAs cannot be quickly adjusted, or no parallel data access exists, one can reach out to other verifiers. The AEA has a <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-third-party">policy</a> on that, and we regularly reach out to folks who we know have access. That would be the case for the SOEP above: reach out to a replicator in Europe (for instance, a fellow Europe-based data editor).</p>

<p>More generally, this will be true for data that have complicated and long-winding access procedures, and where simply it is completely out-of-scope (because illegal) for researchers to provide journals with access to the data. This was the case for the <a href="https://www.casd.eu/en/sources/french-customs-data/">French customs data</a> that we used in the <a href="https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/2021-10-28-reproducibility-restricted-france.html">Piveteau (2021) replication</a>. The data are available through <a href="https://www.casd.eu/">CASD</a>, the French data access center, and the <a href="https://www.cascad.tech/">cascad</a> replicators have access to CASD, quickly, on a case-by-case basis. We can reach out to them for access to these data. Sometimes, agency or data custodian staff themselves can help out - we’ve had pilot projects with the German IAB, with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and with the World Bank. This will not always work - volunteering time may be fine in academia, but is not always feasible when working with government or supra-national agencies.</p>

<p>But back to Toni’s point: in principle, if we applied that principle to the journal-centric process, one solution is to have external referees, selected because they have access to the data, conduct the verification, in accordance with some basic principles.</p>

<h2 id="taking-the-computations-to-the-data-instead-of-the-data-to-my-computer">Taking the computations to the data, instead of the data to “my” computer</h2>

<p>Toni also wanted to “replicate results on an air-gapped machine.” While that specific security protocol almost certainly won’t satisfy many data providers these days (they want encrypted hard drives, secure login processes, etc., and want the whole thing documented), this does also suggest another process: rather than bring the data to “my” computer, take the computation to “their” computer (or some other authorized system). In a few cases, we have been granted (legitimate, documented) computer access to servers that are authorized to access the restricted data, always remaining in compliance with the authors’ data access protocol. We have so far been granted legitimate and documented access to computers at UC San Diego, the NBER, Harvard Business School, and University of Uppsala, to name a few (thank you!). This not only solves the data access problem, in some cases it also solves the computational resource problem - sufficient parallel cores, licensed software, etc. This is different from the third-party verification process, above, because in this case, we (the journal verifiers) access the data, and run the code that the authors provided elsewhere.</p>

<h2 id="the-big-caveat">The big caveat</h2>

<p>Of course, none of the above will work if the original NDA and data access is idiosyncratic. In all of the above processes, a secondary outcome is that we can improve the authors’ description of how <strong>somebody</strong> (not just the editorial folks) can get access to the data, and restrictions limiting this. In some cases, the only possible documentation is “<strong>this will not work for anybody else.</strong>” Getting access to firm-specific data is often heavily dependent on interpersonal relationships, and while that might work to simply extending an NDA, it only works if the original relationship continues to exist. So none of these methods will work in all cases. The fallback is then something that Toni’s journal, and a few other econ journals, but not the AEA (!), require: provide some synthetic or simulated data, that at least allows to assess that the code would in principle run. But at least the fact that access <strong>is</strong> idiosyncratic should be made clear.</p>

<h2 id="some-data-from-us">Some data from us</h2>

<p>So how does this work at the AEA in practice? I pulled some stats today from our tracking system. Over the past 12 months, <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/forms/data-code-availability">authors have identified</a> <strong>112 times</strong> that they might be able to provide us privately access to the data, through one of the mechanisms above. In <strong>86 cases</strong>, after review of conditions, cost, and availability of resources, we pursued those offers in some fashion. That includes figuring out NDAs or privately shared data. It does not cover when we requested data ourselves from third parties, which happened in <strong>22 cases</strong> (some of those cases overlap). In <strong>84 cases</strong>, one of those methods culminated with us coming to terms with whoever controlled the data, and  obtaining access to the data.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Accessing confidential data as part of the verification process is not easy, but it is possible. Ensuring that others can re-use the data is sometimes easier, especially for researchers in the same field, in others harder, when a special clause in the NDA allowed the journal access, but cannot be extended to arbitrary future researchers. And the process must be allowed to fail, because interesting and illuminating research can be conducted with data that cannot be shared. In fact, an update to one of those NDAs negotiations just hit my inbox as I am writing this, and is likely to fail, due to the data provider not being willing to grant an exception or an extension in line with Toni’s original hope and request. That’s life, and is fine - it will not hold up the rest of the verification process that we are conducting, and will still ultimately lead to the publication of the paper.</p>

<p>I see our goal as (data) editors to make these kind of constraints as clear as possible, for all future readers, for a very long time. After all, somebody might still want to correct the record in 100 years, or review what we knew now. It’s not like those articles are going anywhere, even if the data just might disappear! See one of the first “<strong>data corrections</strong>” I’m aware of, by Irving Fisher, 1911.<sup id="fnref:irving" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:irving" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="for-depositors">For depositors</h2>

<p>Authors who just received a conditional acceptance from an AEA journal are required to deposit their replication package at openICPSR. New depositors will receive a message with temporary instructions (see below). Authors who received their notification in recent weeks, and who are still working on completing their deposit, will also be contacted.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The deposit of replication packages at openICPSR is temporarily interrupted (see https://umich.edu/announcements/). As a temporary measure, you can satisfy your deposit requirement by following these instructions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>create a ZIP file of your replication package, as you would deposit it on openICPSR. <strong>DO NOT INCLUDE ANY CONFIDENTIAL DATA.</strong></li>
    <li>name the ZIP file “{manuscript number}.zip” (e.g., “AER-2023-0000.zip”)</li>
    <li>upload it at the URL (provided))</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The temporary upload URL is xxxxx. It will only be open as a long as the openICPSR website is inaccessible. Once openICPSR is back online, you will need to complete the normal upload process as outlined at https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/data-deposit-aea.html.
“</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The URL will be contained in the email message that depositors will receive.</p>

<p>IMPORTANT: This only delays, but does not replace the usual deposit process. Authors will ultimately still need to complete the deposit, once openICPSR is back online.</p>

<h2 id="for-interested-readers">For interested readers</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no short-term replacement for access to published replication packages. ICPSR has a robust preservation strategy, and we expect no long-term impact on availability of replication packages. We hope that they are able to resolve the issues affecting their network as soon as possible.</p>

We do get more than a dozen such updates a year (see my <a href="https://aeadataeditor.github.io/publications/">annual reports</a>). I’ll describe the process and give a few examples here.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="when-to-update">When to update</h2>

<p>You should update your replication package if</p>

<ul>
  <li>there is an error in one of the code or data files that was detected subsequent to publication.</li>
  <li>you are aware of an improvement in accessibility of the replication package (data in more robust data formats, additional data documentation, more efficient code)</li>
  <li>you are made aware of some other issue with the replication package that needs to be addressed</li>
</ul>

<p>Only the original authors can make these changes, but anybody can detect such changes. We field change requests coming from students attempting to replicate a package, researchers with access to restricted data that we did not have access to, or authors themselves who noticed, or were made aware of, issues with their deposit. In all cases where the initial notice does not involve the author, the Data Editor, or the Co-editor responsible for the article, will contact the author.</p>

<h2 id="whom-to-contact">Whom to contact</h2>

<p>For changes that do not affect the results in the actual manuscript, it is sufficient to contact the Data Editor (I may still reach out to the Editor in charge). For any corrections that affect manuscript or online appendix tables, figure, results, or conclusions, please contact the Editor in charge first, as these may require a corrigendum, erratum, or other corrections.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The remainder of this post will only address the changes made to the replication package, not to any other published materials.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="how-to-update">How to update</h2>

<p>In a nutshell, this is described in the <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-revisions">policy</a>, you should</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do <strong>NOT</strong> make a new deposit; edit the old deposit (<a href="mailto:dataeditor@aeapubs.org">contact us</a> if you don’t remember who  last accessed the deposit, or if your email has changed), creating a new version (if you didn’t use openICPSR, refer to the relevant repository’s instructions on how to create a new <strong>version</strong>):</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/icpsr-create-new-version.png" alt="Create a new version on openICPSR" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Prepare the changes: Download the <strong>published</strong> archive (not your private copy of it), and make changes to code and/or data.</li>
  <li>Edit the README and possibly create a “Changes.txt” or “Changelog.txt”.</li>
  <li>In the deposit, delete the INDIVIDUAL files that need to be changed, then re-upload them (openICPSR does not allow you to simply replace by uploading… sorry)</li>
  <li>Make changes to <strong>NO</strong> other files.</li>
  <li><a href="https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/data-deposit-aea.html#submitting-to-the-data-editor">Re-submit</a> to the Data Editor.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-happens-after-update">What happens after update</h2>

<p>After you have submitted the update to the replication package,</p>

<ul>
  <li>the Data Editor will review the deposit for compliance with the  <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-revisions">policy</a>. Changes may be requested.</li>
  <li>the Data Editor will publish the revised replication package (usually, this becomes <strong>V2</strong>). A new DOI is assigned.</li>
  <li>Depending on the type of change being made, the “version of record” (linked from the article page) is adjusted (see <a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-revisions#version">what the policy has to say about that</a>). NOTE: Usually, the version of record is NOT modified.</li>
  <li>In all cases, accessing the original deposit (<strong>V1</strong>) will show a banner at the top, directing interested parties to the new version.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-revisions#version">https://doi.org/10.3886/E148361V1</a> - <a href="https://doi.org/10.3886/E148361V2">https://doi.org/10.3886/E148361V2</a> - only the README was updated (clarified), see top of the (revised) README. For this one, we updated the version of record - see link at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1257/aeri.20210201">https://doi.org/10.1257/aeri.20210201</a> - because no code was impacted, and the change was a clarification. The change was initiated by the authors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.3886/E172902V1">https://doi.org/10.3886/E172902V1</a> - <a href="https://doi.org/10.3886/E172902V2">https://doi.org/10.3886/E172902V2</a> - A (small) piece of code was corrected. Since this affected the functionality of the code (though no output from the code), this did NOT change version of record - see the link to the replication package at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20200961">https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20200961</a>. A researcher contacted the Data Editor, who then contacted the authors.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://doi.org/10.3886/E184461V1">https://doi.org/10.3886/E184461V1</a> - <a href="https://doi.org/10.3886/E184461V2">https://doi.org/10.3886/E184461V2</a> - A data-related issue (copyright and terms of use) required us to remove some data files from the deposit. This is one of the few cases where a replication package was “de-accessioned” – the original deposit is still viewable (the list of files is still there), but cannot be downloaded. In this case, <strong>V2</strong> became the version of record because (a) <strong>V1</strong> is no longer functional (b) the impact does not affect the results of the (successful) reproduction, though it is now clear that part of the package needs proprietary data.</p>
