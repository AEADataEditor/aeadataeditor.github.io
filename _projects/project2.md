Since July 16, 2019, the American Economic Association has used the [AEA Data and Code Repository](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/aea)  as the default archive for its supplements. The AEA also announced that it would migrate the historical supplements, hitherto stored as ZIP files on the AEA website, into the AEA Data and Code Repository. Between Oct 11 and Oct 13, 2019, openICPSR ingested 2,552 historical supplements. Additional supplements were ingested in December 2019.
