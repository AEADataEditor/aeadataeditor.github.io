Initiated by one of our student replicators ([Lydia Reiner](https://github.com/lydreiner)), this project aims to run a static code analysis on replication packages, identifying Stata packages that are used. This intends to help replicators -- and authors! -- to properly install those packages, improving reproducibility.

The code is in its preliminary stages, but available for testing at <https://github.com/AEADataEditor/Statapackagesearch>.
