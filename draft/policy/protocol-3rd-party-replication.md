# Policy and Protocol for Third-party Verifications

This protocol describes how third parties can, at the request of the AEA Data Editor, conduct a reproducibility check of materials that are part of an AEA publication. 

> Alternate protocols are possible, but should be verified with the AEA Data Editor prior to engaging any resources. 

## Preliminaries

- The author(s) ("Author") of the replication archive or archives should provide a complete and exhaustive archive, ready for publication, to the AEA Data Editor. 
  - The archive does not need to be public at this stage, as long as it can be shared privately.
  - The archive may or may not contain data necessary for the reproducibility check, in particular when data is confidential or proprietary. However, the archive must contain a publishable description of how an independent researcher can access the data ("data availability statement") once all conditions for access have been met. 
- The AEA Data Editor will have verified the archive.
  - All other conditions of the [Data and Code Availability Policy](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code) must still be met, including data citations.

## What or Who Is a Third-party Replicator

The third-party replicator is somebody not affiliated with the AEA editorial offices ("Third-party"), who has access to the (public-use, confidential or restricted) data used in the Author's paper, and who 

- has not been involved with the Author's research project
- has disclosed any conflicts of interest
- promises to conduct an arms-length reproducibility exercise, with no direct interaction with the author (other than to undertake specific steps to access the data)

## Steps for the Third-party Replicator

- Download the Author's replication archive(s) from the location provided by the AEA Data Editor (public, or privately shared)
  - The Third-party should not obtain any code or instructions directly from the Author.
- Ensure access to any confidential files that are described in the replication archive's README
  - The Third-party should consider whether a  person not familiar with the precise data environment could reasonably find and access the data, based solely on the instructions in the README
- Follow the [checklist](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Verification_guidance.html) to conduct the reproducibility exercise, relying exclusively on the README for instructions and guidance.
- Write a [report](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/REPLICATION.md)
- Send the report to the AEA Data Editor
- Report any interactions with the Author in the course of conducting the reproducibility exercise (help, assistance, clarifications)
