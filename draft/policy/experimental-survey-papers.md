Special rules for  papers conducting experiments and collecting primary data
===========================================================================

For experimental papers and papers that collect primary data via surveys, additional rules apply. 
We normally expect authors of such articles to supply the following supplementary
materials (any exceptions to this policy should be requested at the time
of submission):

Original Instructions
---------------------

The original instructions should be summarized as part of the discussion
of experimental design or the survey design in the submitted manuscript, and also provided in
full as an appendix at the time of submission. The instructions should
be presented in a way that, together with the design summary, conveys
the protocol clearly enough that the design could be replicated by a
reasonably skilled experimentalist or survey specialist. For example, if different
instructions were used for different sessions or survey branches, the correspondence should
be indicated.

Subject Selection
-----------------

Information about subject eligibility or selection, such as exclusions
based on past participation in experiments, college major, demographic characteristics,
etc. This
should be summarized as part of the discussion of  design in
the submitted manuscript.

Software and Scripts
--------------------

Any computer programs, configuration files, or scripts used to run the
experiment or program the survey instrument shall be provided. These should be summarized as appropriate
in the submitted manuscript and deposited in the AEA Data and Code
Repository. All requirements noted above for programs apply.

Examples include [z-Tree](https://www.ztree.uzh.ch/en.html) code, 
[Qualtrics](https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-tools/import-and-export-surveys/), 
[LimeSurvey](https://www.limesurvey.org/) or similar survey instrument specifications. 

Where appropriate, human-readable versions of the experiment or instrument (PDF of questionnaire) shall also be provided.

Raw Data
--------

The raw data from the experiment or survey should be summarized as appropriate in
the submitted manuscript, and deposited in the AEA Data and Code
Repository, compliant with any confidentiality protections that apply.

We strongly encourage authors to deposit raw data and instructions
separately from other replication materials, in order to provide greater
visibility to the author's work.

Analysis Programs
-----------------

All requirements for final and intermediate data files, as well as
cleaning and analysis programs, as per our general [Data and Code Availability Policy](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/data-code), 
continue to apply.
