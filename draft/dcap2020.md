It is the policy of the American Economic Association to publish papers
only if the data and code used in the analysis are clearly and precisely
documented, and access to the data and code is clearly and precisely
documented and is non-exclusive to the authors.

Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or
experimental work must provide, prior to acceptance, information about
the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to
permit replication, as well as information about access to data and
programs.

Data and programs should be archived in the [*AEA Data and Code
Repository*](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/aea)
(<https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/aea>).[^2] 
Authors will provide access to editors and reviewers, if
requested, to both data and programs prior to acceptance. The Editor
should be notified at the time of submission if access to the data used
in a paper is restricted or limited, or if, for some other reason, the
requirements above cannot be met. If data or programs cannot be published openly, 
authors commit to preserving data and code for a period of no less than 5 (five) years
following publication of the manuscript, and to providing reasonable assistance 
to requests for clarification and replication. 

The AEA Data Editor will assess
compliance with this policy, and will verify the accuracy of the
information prior to acceptance by the Editor.


Content and Scope
=================

For econometric, simulation, and experimental papers, the replication
materials shall include (a) the data set(s), (b) the programs used to
create any final and analysis data sets from raw data, (c) programs used
to run the final models, and (d) description sufficient to allow all
programs to be run.

For papers collecting original data, through surveys or experiments, the 
replication materials shall include, in addition to the materials listed above,
(e) survey instruments as used (f) computer code for survey collection mechanisms 
or experiments (g) original instructions and details on subject selection.

All data used in the paper shall be cited. We also encourage citation of software packages. 
In addition, data availability statements shall be provided as part of the replication package,
and may be provided as part of online appendices.

Registration
============

The AEA has a policy on the registration of randomized control trials.
Please see the policy at
<https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/rct-registry>.

Ethics approval
===============

If applicable, approval by ethics boards (Institutional Review Boards, IRB, in the United States, and equivalent institutions elsewhere) should be demonstrated 
by including the name of the ethics board and any approval or exemption record number in the title footnote as well as in author disclosure statements. See the disclosure policy at https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/disclosure-policy. 

Instructions
============

Detailed instructions for preparing replication packages, citing data, and 
depositing replication packages are provided on the [AEA Data Editor's webpages].
