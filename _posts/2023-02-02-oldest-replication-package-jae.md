After our recent discussion about the oldest **AEA** replication package, I navigated over to the **really** old archive at the Journal of Applied Econometrics. Surprise!

<!-- more -->

After all these years of loving maintenance by James MacKinnon, pioneer of data archives, it has migrated from old-style web pages ([gopher pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)), originally, I think!)

The new JAE archive is now at ZBW in Germany.

## Old pages

The [old pages](http://qed.econ.queensu.ca/jae/legacy.html) were at Queen's University, Kingston, ON, Canada.
