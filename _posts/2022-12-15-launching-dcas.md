The data editors of the journals of the [American Economic Association](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals)[^aea], of the [Royal Economic Society](https://res.org.uk/journals/)[^res], the [Review of Economic Studies](https://www.restud.com/),  the [Canadian Journal of Economics](https://www.economics.ca/cpages/cje-home), and [Economic Inquiry](https://weai.org/view/EI) have joined forces  to proudly launch **DCAS**, the [Data and Code Availability Standard](https://datacodestandard.org/). This set of rules regarding what constitutes an appropriate data and code replication package will help authors comply with journalsâ€™ data and code availability policies. DCAS provides a standard, meant to make compliance easier by setting common requirements across all participating journals, and to help journals create and align their data and code availability policy.

[^aea]: The journals of the American Economic Association are the American Economic Review, AER: Insights, and the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, Economic Policy, Macroeconomics, and Microeconomics. 
[^res]: The journals of the Royal Economic Society are the Econometrics Journal and the Economic Journal.
