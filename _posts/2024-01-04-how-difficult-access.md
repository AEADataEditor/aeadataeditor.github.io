# How difficult is access to data?

## three categories

a. Relatively easy to obtain access (E.g., we could define easy as cost<$1000 and requires less than 40 hrs of time)
b. Access very likely if spending significant resources (think of sworn Census status; access to Nordic data, etc., expensive data sets, like Medicare claims data)
c. Access possible in theory, but far from clear the owner of the data could be persuaded to agree to access (data from a private firm with which the authors had a relationship, and so on)

## five categories

## Ambiguity

### Person controlling access

Whether Prof. Decarolis will respond to inquiries is open to question, but is not in the control of the authors.

### Zillow and Pre-Musk Twitter

Zillow used to allow researchers to request Ztrax data - on real estate transactions. The access was free, upon signature of an agreement with your university.

However, they sunset the program in July of 2019, and the last (time-limited) data use agreements expired this fall. Even since 2019, no new requests were accepted, but a researcher, say, with a project from 2018, could have been publishing as recently as this year. (My recollection is that the last Ztrax paper came through in 2022).

Nobody at present can access the data anymore.

But in 2022, there were people who had access to the data, but under no circumstances could anybody else access the data.
