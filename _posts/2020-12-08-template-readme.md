We have released the first version of a template README for social sciences at <https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/>.

<!-- more -->

## Release

The template README provided on [this website](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/) is in a form that follows best practices as defined by a number of data editors at social science journals.

## Contributors

Joint work with the [Review of Economic Studies](https://twitter.com/RevEconStud) (Data Editor [Miklos KÃ³ren](https://twitter.com/korenmiklos)), [Economic Journal](https://twitter.com/EJ_RES) (Data Editor [Joan Llull](https://www.barcelonagse.eu/people/llull-joan)) and the [Canadian Journal of Economics](https://twitter.com/CanEconomics) (Data Editor [Marie Connolly](http://www.connolly.uqam.ca/) and previously [Peter Morrow ](https://twitter.com/p_morrow_uoft)). 

We encourage use at [AEA journals](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/) immediately, and will start to verify usage in May 2021.

We also got input from editors at JOLE (Journal of Labor Economics), JPE (Journal of Political Economy), Management Science ([Ben Greiner](https://twitter.com/bgreiner_tweets)), and JASA (Journal of the American Statistical Association) ([Chris Paciorek](https://twitter.com/ChrisPaciorek)) (see JASA's version at <https://jasa-acs.github.io/repro-guide/pages/acc.html>). We hope to get additional input from others.

## Purpose and Content

What is the README for? README in the social sciences serve multiple purposes: guiding a reader through the available material, a route to replicating the results in the research paper, including the description of the origins of data and/or description of programs.

We provide templates/examples for Data and Code Availability Statement: 

- where do the data come from (see the [Data Citation Principles[(https://www.force11.org/datacitationprinciples)), 
- any access restrictions, 
- how the data can be used (licenses). 

Prove that you are allowed to distribute, help others get access, provide not just an URL! (we provide examples!)

Of course, it contains a (detailed) set of instructions to run the code. But also **requirements**: 

- do you need a laptop from 2010, or a cloud cluster with 102 nodes?
- Runs in 5 minutes, days, weeks, months? 
- What packages/dependencies? (we provide examples!)
- Random seed

We note that a good replication package uses a minimal number of automated scripts, with no manual interventions required unless absolutely unavoidable.

The template README has been battle-tested in our attempts (across all of our journals AEA/Restud/EJ/CJE) to assess (computationally, or just by reading) the READMEs of more than 500 articles. If we suggest you provide the information, it's because it is useful.
