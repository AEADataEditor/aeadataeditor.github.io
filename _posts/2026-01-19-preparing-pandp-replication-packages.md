For authors preparing the replication packages that accompany their 2026 AEA Papers and Proceedings publication [www.aeaweb.org/journals/pandp](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/pandp): Here are some notes on preparing your replication package.

Much of the preparation for papers published in Papers and Proceedings is the same as for the AEA journals, see [Step 1 for basic preparation](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/preparing-for-data-deposit.html) & [Step 2 if depositing at the AEA Data and Code repository](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/aea-de-guidance/data-deposit-aea.html).

However, our compliance check is more limited than the checks conducted for peer-reviewed papers. Your replication package must nevertheless be fully compliant with the [AEA Data and Code Availability Policy](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/data-code-policy).

This means: Should a reader or user of your replication package find errors or omissions at a later stage, you will be asked to remedy the situation in line with our [Policy on Revisions of Data and Code Deposits](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/data/policy-revisions).

## What do we do?

My replicators will review the deposit, review the README, and send you a filled-out checklist, verifying compliance with each item. If you want to get a perfect score (gamification!) you can find a [printable checklist here](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/assets/pdfs/aea-de-pre-publication-verification-form.pdf).

## Repository choices

The use of the [AEA Data & Code Repository](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/aea) is strongly encouraged. Other repositories and archives considered to be "trusted" may be acceptable - if you ALREADY have a replication package @ Dataverse/Zenodo/etc. please use that (Github is NOT a "trusted" archive).
