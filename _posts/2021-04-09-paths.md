A short thread (PSA) on a FOC (frequently occurring problem) that shouldn't be one: file paths in statistical software.

<!-- more -->

Comment in a recent reply to one of our replication reports (note: this was not actually a problem):

> "We use a HPC and a Linux environment. Therefore, the folders are separated by / and not \ . This might
create problems if working with Windows."

Actually, it does not!

## Stata

Every **Stata** user (but in particular those on Windows) should know ðŸ‘‡. Rule: ALWAYS use "`/`", NEVER "`\`" and you should be fine.

## R

use "`file.path('path','file')`" or even use packages [`here`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/here/vignettes/here.html) or [`rprojroot`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rprojroot/vignettes/rprojroot.html).

## Matlab 

Use "`/`" and it will do the right thing.

## Python

`os.path.join()` is your friend

## Others

And there are likely similar functions in lots of other programming languages and statistical software.

## Take away

Be aware of and always use the platform independent coding of paths, either a function or using "`/`". NEVER use "`\`".
