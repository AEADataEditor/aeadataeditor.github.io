title: Draft policy 
layout: withtoc

It is the policy of the American Economic Association to publish papers
only if the data and code used in the analysis are clearly and precisely
documented, and access to the data and code is clearly and precisely
documented and is non-exclusive to the authors.

Authors of accepted papers that contain empirical work, simulations, or
experimental work must provide, prior to acceptance, information about
the data, programs, and other details of the computations sufficient to
permit replication, as well as information about access to data and
programs.

Data and programs should be archived in the [*AEA Data and Code
Repository*](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/aea)
(<https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/aea>).[^2] 
Authors will provide access to editors and reviewers, if
requested, to both data and programs prior to acceptance. The Editor
should be notified at the time of submission if access to the data used
in a paper is restricted or limited, or if, for some other reason, the
requirements above cannot be met. 

If data or programs cannot be published in an openly accessible trusted data repository, 
authors commit to preserving data and code for a period of no less than 5 (five) years
following publication of the manuscript, and to providing reasonable assistance 
to requests for clarification and replication. 

The AEA Data Editor will assess
compliance with this policy, and will verify the accuracy of the
information prior to acceptance by the Editor.


## Content and Scope

For econometric, simulation, and experimental papers, the replication
materials shall include (a) the data set(s), (b) description sufficient to 
access all data at their original source location, (c) the programs used to
create any final and analysis data sets from raw data, (d) programs used
to run the final models, and (e) description sufficient to allow all
programs to be run.

For papers collecting original data, through surveys or experiments, the 
replication materials shall include, in addition to the materials listed above,
(f) survey instruments or experiment instructions (g) computer code for experiment or survey collection mechanisms 
(h) original instructions and details on subject selection. See the [Supplementary policy on experimental and survey papers](policy/experimental-survey-papers.md).

### Data and Software Citations

All source data used in the paper shall be cited, following the [AEA Sample References](https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/sample-references). We also encourage citation of software packages. 

### Data Availability Statements

Data availability statements shall be provided as part of the replication package, covering both the source data and any provided derivative data. These statements  may be provided as part of online appendices. Data availability statements shall provide detailed information on
how, where, and under what conditions an independent researcher can
access the original source data as well as author-generated derivative data, and must be explicit and accurate about any restrictions, requirements, payments, and processing delays. The data availability statements shall provide information to
assure the reader that the data are available for a sufficiently long
period of time.

### Non-public Data

This policy, with the exception of item (a), also applies to papers that use data that cannot be published as part of a replication package, 
or in an openly accessible trusted data repository.  Examples include confidential data with person or business identifying information and 
data subject to data use agreements or copyrights that prohibit redistribution.
When possible, a private (not to be published) version of the data should be provided to the AEA Data Editor, and/or 
a third-party replicator designated who can provide a [third-party reproducibility report](policy/protocol-3rd-party-replication.md).


### Formats 

The data files can be provided in any format compatible with any
commonly used statistical package or software. Authors are encouraged to
provide data files in open, non-proprietary formats. 
Authors should ensure that a meaningful name or description (label) is
available for every variable in provided datasets. Codebooks or similar
metadata should describe the allowed values and their meaning for each
variable. It is acceptable to reference publicly available documentation
for these items.


The programs can be provided in any format compatible with commonly used
statistical package or software. Should unusual or costly software be
required, the Authors are required to notify the AEA Data Editor.
A master script is strongly encouraged.

### Metadata

As part of the archive, authors must provide a README file listing all
included files and documenting the purpose, format, and provenance of
each file provided, as well as instructing a user on how replication can be conducted. The README shall contain the Data Availability Statement and use proper citations, including for all data used.

> The README shall follow the  schema as provided by the [Social Science Data Editors' template README](https://github.com/social-science-data-editors/template_README).

Common formats are txt, PDF, and Markdown. The README file should not
require proprietary software to view. It should guide a user on the
types of files and how to use them to do replication.

### Version of Record

After review, a data and code deposit will be accepted by the AEA Data Editor, and becomes the version of record associated with 
the paper. Corrections and revisions are subject to the [Policy on Data and Code Revisions](policy/revisions-data-code-deposit.md).


## Registration

The AEA has a policy on the registration of randomized control trials. All such registrations shall be cited in the title footnote, and elsewhere in the paper as appropriate.
Please see the policy at
<https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/rct-registry>.

## Ethics approval

If applicable, approval by ethics boards (Institutional Review Boards, IRB, in the United States, and equivalent institutions elsewhere) should be demonstrated 
by including the name of the ethics board and any approval or exemption record number in the title footnote as well as in author disclosure statements. See the disclosure policy at https://www.aeaweb.org/journals/policies/disclosure-policy. 

## Instructions

Detailed instructions for preparing replication packages, citing data, and 
depositing replication packages are provided in the [AEA Data Editor's step-by-step guide](guidance/step-by-step.html).
