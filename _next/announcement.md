On July 16, 2019, we announced a [revised and expanded data and code availability policy](https://www.aeaweb.org/news/member-announcements-july-16-2019). After a year of applying the new policy, talking and listening to authors and editors, both at the AEA and in the broader economics community, we are clarifying several aspects of the policy.

We emphasize that the clarified policy of (DATE) requires no new content to be provided by authors (with one small exception). Rather, it is meant to codify the practices that have emerged over the past year, clarify various requirements in the existing policy, and provide additional guidance. 

## Required README

We are, however, requiring that authors henceforth provide a [standardized README](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/template-README.html) as part of the replication package. The README specifies various elements that are necessary for a complete replication package, and the template README we provide contains explanatory text on all such elements. Importantly, this README is not just a requirement for the AEA journals. Its form and content have been coordinated with several other economics journals, and the template is made available at [https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/template-README.html](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/template_README/template-README.html). In particular, the README should contain detailed information on data provenance ("data availability statements"), software and hardware requirements for replication, steps required to conduct a (mostly automated) replication, and expected output (tables, figures, in-text numbers).

Correctly completed README files are  accepted as sufficient documentation at several economics journals, and we hope to expand that list through cooperation and coordination. 

## Improved Guidance

We have separated policy from specific and detailed guidance, and greatly expanded the latter. We now offer specific guidance for various phases of the submission process:
- Preparing the replication package, which can happen as early as just prior to submission
- Providing metadata and uploading the replication package, which happens at the latest after a conditional acceptance has been issued by the journal editor, but might happen during a revise-and-resubmit.
- Improved process to alert the AEA Data Editor of the location of the data and code deposit, including when either are not at the AEA Data and Code Repository (and obviating the need to submit the README in two places).

## Clarification of scope: Data citations

We have explicitly noted in the policy that data are to be cited, in accordance with both the Data and Code Availability policy as well as the AEA Sample References. We note that in many cases, providing data citations in the manuscript is not sufficient to fully describe the provenance of data files, and should be augmented by the "data availability statements" that are part of the README.

## Clarification of scope: Surveys (New)

The AEA Data and Code Availability Policy previously had an explicit section referring to the materials that should be provided for experimental papers. We have expanded the scope of this section to also apply to papers for which authors conducted their own surveys. 

While new, most authors have already been providing these materials, in the interest of transparency. 

The requirements for experimental and survey papers have been split out into a new "[Supplementary policy on experimental and survey papers](https://aeadataeditor.github.io/next/policy/experimental-survey-papers.html)" for ease of reference.

## Clarification: Ethics approval

While the AEA has always required evidence of ethics approval (in the USA, through an institutional review board), the Data and Code Availability explicitly informs users of this requirement, as it relates to the legitimacy of the data collection. 

## New: Policy on revisions of deposits and definition of version of record

As we have been reviewing deposits, the need sometimes arises to revise a deposit. In some cases, the changes are not substantive (for instance, clarification of documentation), in others, it might affect the reproducible results. We have defined the version of record of a replication package, and created a policy on data and code revisions. In some cases, the version of record might be changed. In all cases, readers of the article and users of the replication package are alerted to the presence of prior or subsequent versions.
