## Abstract

Journals require that you share your code and data in a replication package upon acceptance. However, efficient reproducibility starts at the beginning of the research project. Following some best practices from day 1 can not only help you prepare a replication package later, but also make you a more productive researcher. In this workshop, we start with an empty folder and finish with a mini-project about public procurement across various European countries, ready for submission to a journal. Together we discuss and document all the choices we make about data collection and analysis, in a way that can help future readers of our research. For advanced topics, see [Session 2](2024-01-06-san-antonio).
