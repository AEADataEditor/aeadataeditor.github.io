## Abstract

Research has to be transparent in order to be considered as credible and valid. Reproduction and replication are practices that seek to establish the validity of research. At the same time, replication is a time-consuming activity that may be conflicting with the pursuit of other goals of research in social sciences, such as originality, relevance and plausibility. The panel will discuss fundamental aims and incentives of replication as well as concrete tools, procedures and publication outlets.
