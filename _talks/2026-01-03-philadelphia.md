## Abstract

Journals require that you share your code and data in a replication package upon acceptance. However, efficient reproducibility starts at the beginning of the research project. Following some best practices can not only help you prepare a replication package later, but also make you a more productive researcher. In this workshop, we start with an empty folder and demonstrate methods to keep your project reproducible from Day 1.  For advanced topics, see [Session 2](2026-01-04-philadelphia). 

*Marie Connolly is Data Editor for the Canadian Journal of Economics. The session was jointly sponsored by the AEA and the Econometric Society.*
