## Abstract

Open Science is a key ingredient for credible research. Many also think that it is hard. We provide an accessible introduction into the topic and the concepts. We distill results from surveys of 100s of economists and reproducibility checks on 1000s of replication packages into practical guidance on best practices for a variety of topics for your research. Participants in the workshop will be more effective in their research throughout the lifecycle of a project.
