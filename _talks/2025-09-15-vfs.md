## Abstract

Over the past years, several international associations in economics have introduced systematic reproducibility checks of submissions and a number of initiatives have been coordinating large scale efforts to conduct ex-post reproducibility checks of published papers. Beyond reproducibility, replications in a wider sense and meta studies have been conducted to better understand the patterns of production and selection of empirical results for publication. The panel discusses the insights gained so far from pursuing this agenda, practical examples from different institutional contexts as well as pathways and pitfalls ahead.
