## Abstract

Miklós Koren and Lars Vilhuber, data editors of the Review of Economic Studies and the American Economic Association Journals require that you share your code and data in a replication package at the end of your research project. Following some best practices from day 1 can not only help you prepare this package later, but also make you a more productive researcher. In this workshop, we start with an empty folder and finish with a mini-project about public procurement across various European countries. Together we discuss and document all the choices we make about data collection and analysis, in a way that can help future readers of our research.

The workshop is organised by the EEA's [Research Committee](https://www.eeassoc.org/committees/research-committee).
