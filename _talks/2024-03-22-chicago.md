## Abstract

**Questions and Coffee with AEA Data Editor Lars Vilhuber**

Are you a researcher in the midst of preparing a replication package and are
unsure about something? Are you a student wondering how complicated putting
together a reproducible thesis may be? Are you unsure if the data you are
using can be used in a replication package? Bring your coffee or tea,
drop-in and ask Lars Vilhuber questions! Lars has been the AEA Data Editor
for the past 6 years, and he'll try to answer them!

*Local organizer*: Thibaut Lamadon, Mikhail Golosov
