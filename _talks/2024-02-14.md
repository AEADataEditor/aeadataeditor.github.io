## Abstract

The growing focus on archiving and curating research data, along with promoting reproducible research, is highly relevant to our faculty and graduate students across all domains of empirical social sciences. This relevance is underscored by the considerable progress in the AEA data policy.

This event is sponsored by the Business, Economics, & Entrepreneurship department at NYU libraries as part of NYU Data Services' Love Data Week 2024.
