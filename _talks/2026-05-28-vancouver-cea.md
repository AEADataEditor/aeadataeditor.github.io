## Abstract

This intensive training explores the fundamental principles of reproducibility, a pillar of open science that
ensures the transparency and credibility of scientific research. You will discover best practices to make your
work reproducible, from data management to code documentation, version control, and results publication.

## OBJECTIVES

-  Master the challenges and principles of research reproducibility
-  Acquire technical skills to create reproducible projects
-  Learn to effectively document your analyses and code
-  Develop concrete strategies for data management and sharing

## WHO SHOULD ATTEND

This training is intended for researchers of all levels (graduate students, faculty, research staff) with experience in empirical data analysis. Knowledge of at least one statistical software package (Stata, R, Python, MATLAB) is required.
Participants must bring their own laptop with their preferred statistical software.

## TRAVEL GRANTS FOR STUDENTS

Non-local students who would like to apply for a limited number of $500 travel grants should apply separately (Link Forthcoming). Applications must be received by April 30. If over-subscribed, grants will be allocated via random draw. Recipients will be notified by May 15, 2026. Grants will be paid out after attendance at the workshop, upon presentation of receipts for travel expenses in the recipients name.
