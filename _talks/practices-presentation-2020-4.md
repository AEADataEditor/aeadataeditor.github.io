## Abstract

Description: Reproducibility and replicability are critical elements of credible scientific research. Data provenance is an important, but often neglected piece of replicability.
In particular when data cannot be published, but can be accessed by shared community, properly documenting provenance is essential, but difficult.
I report on the experience gathered from nearly 1,000 reproducibility reports, and on the guidance we give to authors in order to provide good-enough data provenance.
