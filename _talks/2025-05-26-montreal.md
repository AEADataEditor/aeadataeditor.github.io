## Abstract

This intensive (1.5 day) training explores the fundamental principles of reproducibility, a pillar of open science that ensures the transparency and credibility of scientific research. You will discover best practices to make your work reproducible, from data management to code documentation, version control and results publication.

*Sponsored by [QICSS](https://ciqss.org)*, part of the [Canadian Economics Association meetings pre-program](https://www.economics.ca/cea2025). Paid registration required.
