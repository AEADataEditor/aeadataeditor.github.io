## Abstract

The NEEDLS group is co-led by Charissa Jefferson, Labor Economics Librarian, Princeton University Library and Whitney Kramer, ILR Research and Data Librarian at Cornell University, and is composed of data-oriented librarians around North-East universities. 

The Data Editor met with the group to explain the AEA Data and Code Availability Policy, and to discuss the challenges and opportunities of data sharing in economics. In particular, the exchange was meant to provide information about how to improve education on data acumen at all levels (undergraduate, graduate, and faculty).
