## Abstract

Data editors describe possible steps to self-check replication packages before submitting them to a journal. It is not meant to be exhaustive, and it is not meant to be prescriptive. There are many ways to construct a replication package, and many more to check that it works. Questions from the audience are encouraged. Participants are encouraged to also attend [Tutorial 1](2026-01-03-philadelphia).  

*Marie Connolly is Data Editor for the Canadian Journal of Economics. The session was jointly sponsored by the AEA and the Econometric Society.*
