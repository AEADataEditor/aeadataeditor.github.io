## Abstract

The LDI Replication Lab verifies computational reproducibility of papers appearing in AEA journals with undergraduate students, who experience hands-on engagement with data and code for conditionally accepted manuscripts. We believe that exposure to and training in well-structured programming will benefit students both in academia and the private sector. They become resourceful in debugging (inevitably) imperfect code submitted to the AEA journals, and are taught how to communicate with other people on technical problems, in an objective and constructive manner. Can or should this be expanded?

> The ZBW Coffee Lectures on Open Science Education are a series of online presentations that showcase examples how to weave the principles, methods, and tools of Open Science into university education. Our Coffee Lectures are tailored specifically for those in the fields of economics and management, though we welcome contributions neighboring disciplines.
