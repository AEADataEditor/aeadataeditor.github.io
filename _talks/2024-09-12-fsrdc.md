## Abstract

**Session 1: "Reproducibility from Day 1"**

Journals require that you share your code and data in a replication package upon acceptance. However, efficient reproducibility starts at the beginning of the research project. Following some best practices from day 1 can not only help you prepare a replication package later, but also make you a more productive researcher. In this workshop, we start with an empty folder and finish with a mini-project about public procurement across various European countries, ready for submission to a journal. Together we discuss and document all the choices we make about data collection and analysis, in a way that can help future readers of our research. For advanced topics, see

**Session 2: "Creating reproducible packages when data are confidential"**

In this second session, I discuss advanced strategies for ensuring reproducibility  for yourself and for others, again with special emphasis on work in the FSRDC.  Questions from the audience are encouraged.
