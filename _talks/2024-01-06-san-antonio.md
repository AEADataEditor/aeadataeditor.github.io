## Abstract

In this second session, data editors describe a few possible steps to self-check replication packages before submitting them to a journal. It is not meant to be exhaustive, and it is not meant to be prescriptive. There are many ways to construct a replication package, and many more to check that it works. Questions from the audience are encouraged. Participants are encouraged to also attend [Session 1](2024-01-05-san-antonio). 

*Marie Connolly is Data Editor for the Canadian Journal of Economics. The session was jointly sponsored by the AEA and the Econometric Society.*
