## Abstract

Do you have questions how the data and code availability policy works at the AEA or other journals, or how to prepare a particularly challenging replication package? Are you a journal editor who is considering implementing a similar policy and have questions? Come and chat with data editors from various journals, including the AEA Data Editor, about suggestions and experiences. Coffee and cookies will be available.
