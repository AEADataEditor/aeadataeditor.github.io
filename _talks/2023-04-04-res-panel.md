## Abstract

Several top journals (including those of the RES) have recently initiated efforts to insure that published empirical results can be replicated. Not all journals have followed suit, however, as this can be expensive. At the same time, many journals are reluctant to publish comments that raise questions about the validity or transparency of published results. The panel will discuss fundamental aims and incentives of replication as well as concrete tools, procedures, and publication outlets.
