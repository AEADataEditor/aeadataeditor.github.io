## Abstract

**Reproducibility in Economics: Open Q&A with the American Economic Association's Data Editor**

Are you a researcher in the midst of preparing a replication package and are
unsure about something? Are you a student wondering how complicated putting
together a reproducible thesis may be? Are you unsure if the data you are
using can be used in a replication package? Bring your coffee or tea,
drop-in and ask Lars Vilhuber questions! Lars has been the AEA Data Editor
for the past 6 years. He will start with a short 15 minute overview of the current standards,
and try to answer all of your questions!

*Local organizer*: James Feigenbaum
