## Abstract

Journals require that you share your code and data in a replication package upon acceptance. However, efficient reproducibility starts at the beginning of the research project. Following some best practices from day 1 can not only help you prepare a replication package later, but also make you a more productive researcher. In this (HANDS-ON) workshop, we start with an empty folder and pursue an initial research idea using reproducible practices, ending with a mini-project ready for submission to a journal. We also discuss techniques on how to self-verify reproducibility at any point of the research lifecycle, but in particular on the Day T of final submission to a journal.
